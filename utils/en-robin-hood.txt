WITH SUCH SKILL AND CUNNING AS HIS NOR WERE THERE EVER SUCH YEOMEN AS THE SEVENSCORE MERRY MEN THAT ROAMED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GREENWOOD SHADES RIGHT MERRILY THEY DWELLED WITHIN THE DEPTHS OF SHERWOOD FOREST SUFFERING NEITHER CARE NOR WANT BUT PASSING THE TIME IN MERRY GAMES OF ARCHERY OR BOUTS OF CUDGEL PLAY LIVING UPON THE KINGS VENISON WASHED DOWN WITH DRAUGHTS OF ALE OF OCTOBER BREWING NOT ONLY ROBIN HIMSELF BUT ALL THE BAND WERE OUTLAWS AND DWELLED APART FROM OTHER MEN YET THEY WERE BELOVED BY THE COUNTRY PEOPLE ROUND ABOUT FOR NO ONE EVER CAME TO JOLLY ROBIN FOR HELP IN TIME OF NEED AND WENT AWAY AGAIN WITH AN EMPTY FIST AND NOW I WILL TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT THAT ROBIN HOOD FELL AFOUL OF THE LAW WHEN ROBIN WAS A YOUTH OF EIGHTEEN STOUT OF SINEW AND BOLD OF HEART THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM PROCLAIMED A SHOOTING MATCH AND OFFERED A PRIZE OF A BUTT OF ALE TO WHOSOEVER SHOULD SHOOT THE BEST SHAFT IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE NOW QUOTH ROBIN WILL I GO TOO FOR FAIN WOULD I DRAW A STRING FOR THE BRIGHT EYES OF MY LASS AND A BUTT OF GOOD OCTOBER BREWING SO UP HE GOT AND TOOK HIS GOOD STOUT YEW BOW AND A SCORE OR MORE OF BROAD CLOTHYARD ARROWS AND STARTED OFF FROM LOCKSLEY TOWN THROUGH SHERWOOD FOREST TO NOTTINGHAM IT WAS AT THE DAWN OF DAY IN THE MERRY MAYTIME WHEN HEDGEROWS ARE GREEN AND FLOWERS BEDECK THE MEADOWS DAISIES PIED AND YELLOW CUCKOO BUDS AND FAIR PRIMROSES ALL ALONG THE BRIERY HEDGES WHEN APPLE BUDS BLOSSOM AND SWEET BIRDS SING THE LARK AT DAWN OF DAY THE THROSTLE COCK AND CUCKOO WHEN LADS AND LASSES LOOK UPON EACH OTHER WITH SWEET THOUGHTS WHEN BUSY HOUSEWIVES SPREAD THEIR LINEN TO BLEACH UPON THE BRIGHT GREEN GRASS SWEET WAS THE GREENWOOD AS HE WALKED ALONG ITS PATHS AND BRIGHT THE GREEN AND RUSTLING LEAVES AMID WHICH THE LITTLE BIRDS SANG WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND BLITHELY ROBIN WHISTLED AS HE TRUDGED ALONG THINKING OF MAID MARIAN AND HER BRIGHT EYES FOR AT SUCH TIMES A YOUTHS THOUGHTS ARE WONT TO TURN PLEASANTLY UPON THE LASS THAT HE LOVES THE BEST AS THUS HE WALKED ALONG WITH A BRISK STEP AND A MERRY WHISTLE HE CAME SUDDENLY UPON SOME FORESTERS SEATED BENEATH A GREAT OAK TREE FIFTEEN THERE WERE IN ALL MAKING THEMSELVES MERRY WITH FEASTING AND DRINKING AS THEY SAT AROUND A HUGE PASTY TO WHICH EACH MAN HELPED HIMSELF THRUSTING HIS HANDS INTO THE PIE AND WASHING DOWN THAT WHICH THEY ATE WITH GREAT HORNS OF ALE WHICH THEY DREW ALL FOAMING FROM A BARREL THAT STOOD NIGH EACH MAN WASCLAD IN LINCOLN GREEN AND A FINE SHOW THEY MADE SEATED UPON THE SWARD BENEATH THAT FAIR SPREADING TREE THEN ONE OF THEM WITH HIS MOUTH FULL CALLED OUT TO ROBIN HULLOA WHERE GOEST THOU LITTLE LAD WITH THY ONE PENNY BOW AND THY FARTHING SHAFTS THEN ROBIN GREW ANGRY FOR NO STRIPLING LIKES TO BE TAUNTED WITH HIS GREEN YEARS NOW QUOTH HE MY BOW AND EKE MINE ARROWS ARE AS GOOD AS SHINE AND MOREOVER I GO TO THE SHOOTING MATCH AT NOTTINGHAM TOWN WHICH SAME HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED BY OUR GOOD SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAMSHIRE THERE I WILL SHOOT WITH OTHER STOUT YEOMEN FOR A PRIZE HAS BEEN OFFERED OF A FINE BUTT OF ALE THEN ONE WHO HELD A HORN OF ALE IN HIS HAND SAID HO LISTEN TO THE LAD WHY BOY THY MOTHERS MILK IS YET SCARCE DRY UPON THY LIPS AND YET THOU PRATEST OF STANDING UP WITH GOOD STOUT MEN AT NOTTINGHAM BUTTS THOU WHO ART SCARCE ABLE TO DRAW ONE STRING OF A TWO STONE BOW ILL HOLD THE BEST OF YOU TWENTY MARKS QUOTH BOLD ROBIN THAT I HIT THE CLOUT AT THREESCORE RODS BY THE GOOD HELP OF OUR LADY FAIR AT THIS ALL LAUGHED ALOUD AND ONE SAID WELL BOASTED THOU FAIR INFANT WELL BOASTED AND WELL THOU KNOWEST THAT NO TARGET IS NIGH TO MAKE GOOD THY WAGER AND ANOTHER CRIED HE WILL BE TAKING ALE WITH HIS MILK NEXT AT THIS ROBIN GREW RIGHT MAD HARK YE SAID HE YONDER AT THE GLADES END I SEE A HERD OF DEER EVEN MORE THAN THREESCORE RODS DISTANT ILL HOLD YOU TWENTY MARKS THAT BY LEAVEOF OUR LADY I CAUSE THE BEST HART AMONG THEM TO DIE NOW DONE CRIED HE WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST AND HERE ARE TWENTY MARKS I WAGER THAT THOU CAUSEST NO BEAST TO DIE WITH OR WITHOUT THE AID OF OUR LADY THEN ROBIN TOOK HIS GOOD YEW BOW IN HIS HAND AND PLACING THE TIP AT HIS INSTEP HE STRUNG IT RIGHT DEFTLY THEN HE NOCKED A BROAD CLOTHYARD ARROW AND RAISING THE BOW DREW THE GRAY GOOSE FEATHER TO HIS EAR THE NEXT MOMENT THE BOWSTRING RANG AND THE ARROW SPED DOWN THE GLADE AS A SPARROWHAWK SKIMS IN A NORTHERN WIND HIGH LEAPED THE NOBLEST HART OF ALL THE HERD ONLY TO FALL DEAD REDDENING THE GREEN PATH WITH HIS HEARTS BLOOD HA CRIED ROBIN HOW LIKEST THOU THAT SHOT GOOD FELLOW I WOT THE WAGER WERE MINE AN IT WERE THREE HUNDRED POUNDS THEN ALL THE FORESTERS WERE FILLED WITH RAGE AND HE WHO HAD SPOKEN THE FIRST AND HAD LOST THE WAGER WAS MORE ANGRY THAN ALL NAY CRIED HE THE WAGER IS NONE OF THINE AND GET THEE GONE STRAIGHTWAY OR BY ALL THE SAINTS OF HEAVEN ILL BASTE THY SIDES UNTIL THOU WILT NEER BE ABLE TO WALK AGAINKNOWEST THOU NOT SAID ANOTHER THAT THOU HAST KILLED THE KINGS DEER AND BY THE LAWS OF OUR GRACIOUS LORD AND SOVEREIGN KING HARRY THINE EARS SHOULD BE SHAVEN CLOSE TO THY HEAD CATCH HIM CRIED A THIRD NAY SAID A FOURTH LET HIM EEN GO BECAUSE OF HIS TENDER YEARS NEVER A WORD SAID ROBIN HOOD BUT HE LOOKED AT THE FORESTERS WITH A GRIM FACE THEN TURNING ON HIS HEEL STRODEAWAY FROM THEM DOWN THE FOREST GLADE BUT HIS HEART WAS BITTERLY ANGRY FOR HIS BLOOD WAS HOT AND YOUTHFUL AND PRONE TO BOIL NOW WELL WOULD IT HAVE BEEN FOR HIM WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN HAD HE LEFT ROBIN HOOD ALONE BUT HIS ANGER WAS HOT BOTH BECAUSE THE YOUTH HAD GOTTEN THE BETTER OF HIM AND BECAUSE OF THE DEEP DRAUGHTS OF ALE THAT HE HAD BEEN QUAFFING SO OF A SUDDEN WITHOUT ANY WARNING HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SEIZED UPON HIS BOW AND FITTED IT TO A SHAFT AY CRIED HE AND ILL HURRY THEE ANON AND HE SENT THE ARROW WHISTLING AFTER ROBIN IT WAS WELL FOR ROBIN HOOD THAT THAT SAME FORESTERS HEAD WAS SPINNING WITH ALE OR ELSE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER STEP AS IT WAS THE ARROW WHISTLED WITHIN THREE INCHES OF HIS HEAD THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND QUICKLY DREW HIS OWN BOW AND SENT AN ARROW BACK IN RETURN YE SAID I WAS NO ARCHER CRIED HE ALOUD BUT SAY SO NOW AGAIN THE SHAFT FLEW STRAIGHT THE ARCHER FELL FORWARD WITH A CRY AND LAY ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND HIS ARROWS RATTLING ABOUT HIM FROM OUT OF HIS QUIVER THE GRAY GOOSE SHAFT WET WITH HIS HEARTS BLOOD THEN BEFORE THE OTHERS COULD GATHER THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM ROBIN HOOD WAS GONE INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE GREENWOOD SOME STARTED AFTER HIM BUT NOT WITH MUCH HEART FOR EACH FEARED TO SUFFER THE DEATH OF HIS FELLOW SO PRESENTLY THEY ALL CAME AND LIFTED THE DEAD MAN UP AND BORE HIM AWAY TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN MEANWHILE ROBIN HOOD RAN THROUGH THE GREENWOOD GONE WAS ALL THE JOY AND BRIGHTNESS FROM EVERYTHING FORHIS HEART WAS SICK WITHIN HIM AND IT WAS BORNE IN UPON HIS SOUL THAT HE HAD SLAIN A MAN ALAS CRIED HE THOU HAST FOUND ME AN ARCHER THAT WILL MAKE THY WIFE TO WRING I WOULD THAT THOU HADST NEER SAID ONE WORD TO ME OR THAT I HAD NEVER PASSED THY WAY OR EEN THAT MY RIGHT FOREFINGER HAD BEEN STRICKEN OFF ERE THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED IN HASTE I SMOTE BUT GRIEVE I SORE AT LEISURE AND THEN EVEN IN HIS TROUBLE HE REMEMBERED THE OLD SAW THAT WHAT IS DONE IS DONE AND THE EGG CRACKED CANNOT BE CURED AND SO HE CAME TO DWELL IN THE GREENWOOD THAT WAS TO BE HIS HOME FOR MANY A YEAR TO COME NEVER AGAIN TO SEE THE HAPPY DAYS WITH THE LADS AND LASSES OF SWEET LOCKSLEY TOWN FOR HE WAS OUTLAWED NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED A MAN BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE HAD POACHED UPON THE KINGS DEER AND TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WERE SET UPON HIS HEAD AS A REWARD FOR WHOEVER WOULD BRING HIM TO THE COURT OF THE KING NOW THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM SWORE THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BRING THIS KNAVE ROBIN HOOD TO JUSTICE AND FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE HE WANTED THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND NEXT BECAUSE THE FORESTER THAT ROBIN HOOD HAD KILLED WAS OF KIN TO HIM BUT ROBIN HOOD LAY HIDDEN IN SHERWOOD FOREST FOR ONE YEAR AND IN THAT TIME THERE GATHERED AROUND HIM MANY OTHERS LIKE HIMSELF CAST OUT FROM OTHER FOLK FOR THIS CAUSE AND FOR THAT SOME HAD SHOT DEER IN HUNGRY WINTERTIME WHEN THEY COULD GET NO OTHER FOOD AND HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE ACT BY THE FORESTERS BUT HAD ESCAPED THUS SAVING THEIR EARS SOME HAD BEEN TURNED OUT OF THEIR INHERITANCE THAT THEIRFARMS MIGHT BE ADDED TO THE KINGS LANDS IN SHERWOOD FOREST SOME HAD BEEN DESPOILED BY A GREAT BARON OR A RICH ABBOT OR A POWERFUL ESQUIRE ALL FOR ONE CAUSE OR ANOTHER HAD COME TO SHERWOOD TO ESCAPE WRONG AND OPPRESSION SO IN ALL THAT YEAR FIVESCORE OR MORE GOOD STOUT YEOMEN GATHERED ABOUT ROBIN HOOD AND CHOSE HIM TO BE THEIR LEADER AND CHIEF THEN THEY VOWED THAT EVEN AS THEY THEMSELVES HAD BEEN DESPOILED THEY WOULD DESPOIL THEIR OPPRESSORS WHETHER BARON ABBOT KNIGHT OR SQUIRE AND THAT FROM EACH THEY WOULD TAKE THAT WHICH HAD BEEN WRUNG FROM THE POOR BY UNJUST TAXES OR LAND RENTS OR IN WRONGFUL FINES BUT TO THE POOR FOLK THEY WOULD GIVE A HELPING HAND IN NEED AND TROUBLE AND WOULD RETURN TO THEM THAT WHICH HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY TAKEN FROM THEM BESIDES THIS THEY SWORE NEVER TO HARM A CHILD NOR TO WRONG A WOMAN BE SHE MAID WIFE OR WIDOW SO THAT AFTER A WHILE WHEN THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO FIND THAT NO HARM WAS MEANT TO THEM BUT THAT MONEY OR FOOD CAME IN TIME OF WANT TO MANY A POOR FAMILY THEY CAME TO PRAISE ROBIN AND HIS MERRY MEN AND TO TELL MANY TALES OF HIM AND OF HIS DOINGS IN SHERWOOD FOREST FOR THEY FELT HIM TO BE ONE OF THEMSELVES UP ROSE ROBIN HOOD ONE MERRY MORN WHEN ALL THE BIRDS WERE SINGING BLITHELY AMONG THE LEAVES AND UP ROSE ALL HIS MERRY MEN EACH FELLOW WASHING HIS HEAD AND HANDS IN THE COLD BROWN BROOK THAT LEAPED LAUGHING FROM STONE TO STONE THEN SAID ROBIN FOR FOURTEEN DAYS HAVE WE SEEN NO SPORT SO NOW I WILL GO ABROAD TO SEEK ADVENTURES FORTHWITH BUT TARRY YE MY MERRY MEN ALL HERE IN THE GREENWOOD ONLY SEE THAT YE MIND WELL MY CALL THREE BLASTS UPON THE BUGLE HORNI WILL BLOW IN MY HOUR OF NEED THEN COME QUICKLY FOR I SHALL WANT YOUR AID SO SAYING HE STRODE AWAY THROUGH THE LEAFY FOREST GLADES UNTIL HE HAD COME TO THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD THERE HE WANDERED FOR A LONG TIME THROUGH HIGHWAY AND BYWAY THROUGH DINGLY DELL AND FOREST SKIRTS NOW HE MET A FAIR BUXOM LASS IN A SHADY LANE AND EACH GAVE THE OTHER A MERRY WORD AND PASSED THEIR WAY NOW HE SAW A FAIR LADY UPON AN AMBLING PAD TO WHOM HE DOFFED HIS CAP AND WHO BOWED SEDATELY IN RETURN TO THE FAIR YOUTH NOW HE SAW A FAT MONK ON A PANNIER LADEN ASS NOW A GALLANT KNIGHT WITH SPEAR AND SHIELD AND ARMOR THAT FLASHED BRIGHTLY IN THE SUNLIGHT NOW A PAGE CLAD IN CRIMSON AND NOW A STOUT BURGHER FROM GOOD NOTTINGHAM TOWN PACING ALONG WITH SERIOUS FOOTSTEPS ALL THESE SIGHTS HE SAW BUT ADVENTURE FOUND HE NONE AT LAST HE TOOK A ROAD BY THE FOREST SKIRTS A BYPATH THAT DIPPED TOWARD A BROAD PEBBLY STREAM SPANNED BY A NARROW BRIDGE MADE OF A LOG OF WOOD AS HE DREW NIGH THIS BRIDGE HE SAW A TALL STRANGER COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE THEREUPON ROBIN QUICKENED HIS PACE AS DID THE STRANGER LIKEWISE EACH THINKING TO CROSS FIRST NOW STAND THOU BACK QUOTH ROBIN AND LET THE BETTER MAN CROSS FIRST NAY ANSWERED THE STRANGER THEN STAND BACK SHINE OWN SELF FOR THE BETTER MAN I WET AM I THAT WILL WE PRESENTLY SEE QUOTH ROBIN AND MEANWHILE STAND THOU WHERE THOU ART OR ELSE BY THE

STAFF TO AWAIT ROBIN THEN ROBIN HOOD STEPPED QUICKLY TO THE COVERSIDE AND CUT A GOOD STAFF OF GROUND OAK STRAIGHT WITHOUT NEW AND SIX FEET IN LENGTH AND CAME BACK TRIMMING AWAY THE TENDER STEMS FROM IT WHILE THE STRANGER WAITED FOR HIM LEANING UPON HIS STAFF AND WHISTLING AS HE GAZED ROUND ABOUT ROBIN OBSERVED HIM FURTIVELY AS HE TRIMMED HIS STAFF MEASURING HIM FROM TOP TO TOE FROM OUT THE CORNER OF HIS EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN A LUSTIER OR A STOUTER MAN TALL WAS ROBIN BUT TALLER WAS THE STRANGER BY A HEAD AND A NECK FOR HE WAS SEVEN FEET IN HEIGHT BROAD WAS ROBINACROSS THE SHOULDERS BUT BROADER WAS THE STRANGER BY TWICE THE BREADTH OF A PALM WHILE HE MEASURED AT LEAST AN ELL AROUND THE WAIST NEVERTHELESS SAID ROBIN TO HIMSELF I WILL BASTE THY HIDE RIGHT MERRILY MY GOOD

DINT OF BLOWS MARRY THAT MEETETH MY WHOLE HEART CRIED THE STRANGER TWIRLING HIS STAFF ABOVE HIS HEAD BETWIXT HIS FINGERS AND THUMB UNTIL IT WHISTLED AGAIN NEVER DID THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHURS ROUND TABLE MEET IN A STOUTER FIGHT THAN DID THESE TWO IN A MOMENT ROBIN STEPPED QUICKLY UPON THE BRIDGE WHERE THE STRANGER STOOD FIRST HE MADE A FEINT AND THEN DELIVERED A BLOW AT THE STRANGERS HEAD THAT HAD IT MET ITS MARK WOULD HAVE TUMBLED HIM SPEEDILY INTO THE WATER BUT THE STRANGER TURNED THE BLOW RIGHT DEFTLY AND IN RETURN GAVE ONE AS STOUT WHICH ROBIN ALSO TURNED AS THE STRANGER HAD DONE SO THEY STOOD EACH IN HIS PLACE NEITHER MOVING A FINGERS BREADTH BACK FOR ONE GOOD HOUR AND MANY BLOWS WERE GIVEN AND RECEIVED BY EACH IN THAT TIME TILL HERE AND THERE WERE SORE BONES AND BUMPS YET NEITHER THOUGHT OF CRYING ENOUGH NOR SEEMED LIKELY TO FALL FROM OFF THE BRIDGE NOW AND THEN THEY STOPPED TO REST AND EACH THOUGHT THAT HE NEVER HAD SEEN IN ALL HIS LIFE BEFORE SUCH A HAND AT QUARTERSTAFF AT LAST ROBIN GAVE THE STRANGER A BLOW UPON THE RIBS THAT MADE HIS JACKET SMOKE LIKE A DAMP STRAW THATCH IN THE SUN SO SHREWD WAS THE STROKE THAT THE STRANGERCAME WITHIN A HAIRS BREADTH OF FALLING OFF THE BRIDGE BUT HE REGAINED HIMSELF RIGHT QUICKLY AND BY A DEXTEROUS BLOW GAVE ROBIN A CRACK ON THE CROWN THAT CAUSED THE BLOOD TO FLOW THEN ROBIN GREW MAD WITH ANGER AND SMOTE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AT THE OTHER BUT THE STRANGER WARDED THE BLOW AND ONCE AGAIN THWACKED ROBIN AND THIS TIME SO FAIRLY THAT HE FELL HEELS OVER HEAD INTO THE WATER AS THE QUEEN PIN FALLS IN A GAME OF BOWLS AND WHERE ART THOU NOW MY GOOD LAD SHOUTED THE STRANGER ROARING WITH LAUGHTER OH IN THE FLOOD AND FLOATING ADOWN WITH THE TIDE CRIED ROBIN NOR COULD HE FORBEAR LAUGHING HIMSELF AT HIS SORRY PLIGHT THEN GAINING HIS FEET

SOUL AND WITHAL A GOOD STOUT STROKE WITH THE CUDGELS BY THIS AND BY THAT MY HEAD HUMMETH LIKE TO A HIVE OF BEES ON A HOT JUNE DAY THEN HE CLAPPED HIS HORN TO HIS LIPS AND WINDED A BLAST THAT WENT

UPON THE STREAM THEY PLUNGED INTO THE FOREST ONCE MORE THROUGH WHICH THEY TRACED THEIR STEPS TILL THEY REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THEY DWELLED IN THEDEPTHS OF THE WOODLAND THERE HAD THEY BUILT HUTS OF BARK AND BRANCHES OF TREES AND MADE COUCHES OF SWEET RUSHES SPREAD OVER WITH SKINS OF FALLOW DEER HERE STOOD A GREAT OAK TREE WITH BRANCHES SPREADING BROADLY AROUND BENEATH WHICH WAS A SEAT OF GREEN MOSS WHERE ROBIN HOOD WAS WONT TO SIT AT FEAST AND AT MERRYMAKING WITH HIS STOUT MEN ABOUT HIM HERE THEY FOUND THE REST OF THE BAND SOME OF WHOM HAD COME IN WITH A BRACE OF FAT DOES THEN THEY ALL BUILT GREAT FIRES AND AFTER A TIME ROASTED THE DOES AND BROACHED A BARREL OF HUMMING ALE THEN WHEN THE FEAST WAS READY THEY ALL SAT DOWN BUT ROBIN PLACED LITTLE JOHN AT HIS RIGHT HAND FOR HE WAS

JOHNS BEARD AND TRICKLE FROM HIS NOSE AND CHIN WHILE HIS EYES BLINKED WITH THE SMART OF IT AT FIRST HE WAS OF A MIND TO BE ANGRY BUT FOUND HE COULD NOT BECAUSE THE OTHERS WERE SO MERRY SO HE TOO LAUGHED WITH THE REST THEN ROBIN TOOK THIS SWEET PRETTY BABE CLOTHED HIM ALL ANEW FROM TOP TO TOE IN LINCOLN GREEN AND GAVE HIM A GOOD STOUT BOW AND SO MADE HIM A MEMBER OF THE MERRY BAND AND THUS IT WAS THAT ROBIN HOOD BECAME OUTLAWED THUS A BAND OF MERRY COMPANIONS GATHERED ABOUT HIM AND THUS HE GAINED HIS RIGHT HAND MAN LITTLE JOHN AND SO THE PROLOGUE ENDS AND NOW I WILL TELL HOW THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM THREE TIMES SOUGHT TO TAKE ROBIN HOOD AND HOW HE FAILED EACH TIMEROBIN HOOD AND THE TINKER NOW IT WAS TOLD BEFORE HOW TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WERE SET UPON ROBIN HOODS HEAD AND HOW THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM SWORE THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD SEIZE ROBIN BOTH BECAUSE HE WOULD FAIN HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND BECAUSE THE SLAIN MAN WAS A KINSMAN OF HIS OWN NOW THE SHERIFF DID NOT YET KNOW WHAT A FORCE ROBIN HAD ABOUT HIM IN SHERWOOD BUT THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT SERVE A WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST AS HE COULD UPON ANY OTHER MAN THAT HAD BROKEN THE LAWS THEREFORE HE OFFERED FOURSCORE GOLDEN ANGELS TO ANYONE WHO WOULD SERVE THIS WARRANT BUT MEN OF NOTTINGHAM TOWN KNEW MORE OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS DOINGS THAN THE SHERIFF DID AND MANY LAUGHED TO THINK OF SERVING A WARRANT UPON THE BOLD OUTLAW KNOWING WELL THAT ALL THEY WOULD GET FOR SUCH SERVICE WOULD BE CRACKED CROWNS SO THAT NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND THUS A FORTNIGHT PASSED IN WHICH TIME NONE CAME FORWARD TO DO THE SHERIFFS BUSINESS THEN SAID HE A RIGHT GOOD REWARD HAVE I OFFERED TO WHOSOEVER WOULD SERVE MY WARRANT UPON ROBIN HOOD AND I MARVEL THAT NO ONE HAS COME TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK THEN ONE OF HIS MEN WHO WAS NEAR HIM SAID GOOD MASTER THOU WOTTEST NOT THE FORCE THAT ROBIN HOOD HAS ABOUT HIM AND HOW LITTLE HE CARES FOR WARRANT OF KING OR SHERIFF TRULY NO ONE LIKES TO GO ON THIS SERVICE FOR FEAR OF CRACKEDCROWNS AND BROKEN BONES THEN I HOLD ALL NOTTINGHAM MEN TO BE COWARDS SAID THE SHERIFF AND LET ME SEE THE MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE THAT DARE DISOBEY THE WARRANT OF OUR SOVEREIGN LORD KING HARRY FOR BY THE SHRINE OF SAINT EDMUND I WILL HANG HIM FORTY CUBITS HIGH BUT IF NO MAN IN NOTTINGHAM DARE WIN FOURSCORE ANGELS I WILL SEND ELSEWHERE FOR THERE SHOULD BE MEN OF METTLE SOMEWHERE IN THIS LAND THEN HE CALLED UP A MESSENGER IN WHOM HE PLACED GREAT TRUST AND BADE HIM SADDLE HIS HORSE AND MAKE READY TO GO TO LINCOLN TOWN TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD FIND ANYONE THERE THAT WOULD DO HIS BIDDING AND WIN THE REWARD SO THAT SAME MORNING THE MESSENGER STARTED FORTH UPON HIS ERRAND BRIGHT SHONE THE SUN UPON THE DUSTY HIGHWAY THAT LED FROM NOTTINGHAM TO LINCOLN STRETCHING AWAY ALL WHITE OVER HILL AND DALE DUSTY WAS THE HIGHWAY AND DUSTY THE THROAT OF THE MESSENGER SO THAT HIS HEART WAS GLAD WHEN HE SAW BEFORE HIM THE SIGN OF THE BLUE BOAR INN WHEN SOMEWHAT MORE THAN HALF HIS JOURNEY WAS DONE THE INN LOOKED FAIR TO HIS EYES AND THE SHADE OF THE OAK TREES THAT STOOD AROUND IT SEEMED COOL AND PLEASANT SO HE ALIGHTED FROM HIS HORSE TO REST HIMSELF FOR A TIME CALLING FOR A POT OF ALE TO REFRESH HIS THIRSTY THROAT THERE HE SAW A PARTY OF RIGHT JOVIAL FELLOWS SEATED BENEATH THE SPREADING OAK THAT SHADED THE GREENSWARD IN FRONT OF THE DOOR THERE WAS A TINKER TWO BAREFOOT FRIARS AND A PARTY OF SIX OF THE KINGS FORESTERS ALL CLAD IN LINCOLN GREEN AND ALL OF THEM WERE QUAFFING HUMMING ALE AND SINGING MERRY BALLADS OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES LOUD LAUGHED THE FORESTERSAS JESTS WERE BANDIED ABOUT BETWEEN THE SINGING AND LOUDER LAUGHED THE FRIARS FOR THEY WERE LUSTY MEN WITH BEARDS THAT CURLED LIKE THE WOOL OF BLACK RAMS BUT LOUDEST OF ALL LAUGHED THE TINKER AND HE SANG MORE SWEETLY THAN ANY OF THE REST HIS BAG AND HIS HAMMER HUNG UPON A TWIG OF THE OAK TREE AND NEAR BY LEANED HIS GOOD STOUT CUDGEL AS THICK AS HIS WRIST AND KNOTTED AT THE END COME CRIED ONE OF THE FORESTERS TO THE TIRED MESSENGER COME JOIN US FOR THIS SHOT HO LANDLORD BRING A FRESH POT OF ALE FOR EACH MAN THE MESSENGER WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN ALONG WITH THE OTHERS WHO WERE THERE FOR HIS LIMBS WERE WEARY AND THE ALE WAS GOOD NOW WHAT NEWS BEAREST THOU SO FAST QUOTH ONE AND WHITHER RIDEST THOU TODAY THE MESSENGER WAS A CHATTY SOUL AND LOVED A BIT OF GOSSIP DEARLY BESIDES THE POT OF ALE WARMED HIS HEART SO THAT SETTLING HIMSELF IN AN EASY CORNER OF THE INN BENCH WHILE THE HOST LEANED UPON THE DOORWAY AND THE HOSTESS STOOD WITH HER HANDS BENEATH HER APRON HE UNFOLDED HIS BUDGET OF NEWS WITH GREAT COMFORT HE TOLD ALL FROM THE VERY FIRST HOW ROBIN HOOD HAD SLAIN THE FORESTER AND HOW HE HAD HIDDEN IN THE GREENWOOD TO ESCAPE THE LAW HOW THAT HE LIVED THEREIN ALL AGAINST THE LAW GOD WOT SLAYING HIS MAJESTYS

NONE HAD SUCH GOOD BEER AND SUCH HUMMING ALE NOR IN WINTERTIME WHEN THE NORTH WIND HOWLED AND SNOW DRIFTED AROUND THE HEDGES WAS THERE TO BE FOUND ELSEWHERE SUCH A ROARING FIRE AS BLAZED UPON THE HEARTH OF THE BLUE BOAR AT SUCH TIMES MIGHT BE FOUND A GOODLY COMPANY OF YEOMEN OR COUNTRY FOLK SEATED AROUND THE BLAZING HEARTH BANDYING MERRY JESTS WHILE ROASTED CRABS BOBBED IN BOWLS OF ALE UPON THE HEARTHSTONE WELL KNOWN WAS THE INN TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND FOR THERE HAD HE AND SUCH MERRY COMPANIONS AS LITTLE JOHN OR WILL STUTELY OR YOUNG DAVID OF DONCASTER OFTEN GATHERED WHEN ALL THE

SPREAD WITH BUTTER FOR ROBIN AND HIS BAND WERE THE BEST OF CUSTOMERS AND PAID THEIR SCORES WITHOUT HAVING THEM CHALKED UP BEHIND THE DOOR SO NOW WHEN ROBIN HOOD AND THE TINKER CAME THERETO AND CALLED

ANCIENT BALLAD OF THE TIME OF GOOD KING ARTHUR CALLED THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE WHICH YOU MAY SOME TIME READ YOURSELF IN STOUT ENGLISH OF EARLY TIMES AND AS HE SANG ALL LISTENED TO THAT NOBLE TALE OF NOBLE KNIGHT AND HIS SACRIFICE TO HIS KING BUT LONG BEFORE THE TINKER CAME TO THE LAST VERSE HIS TONGUE BEGAN TO TRIP AND HIS HEAD TO SPIN BECAUSE OF THE STRONG WATERS MIXED WITH THE ALE FIRSTHIS TONGUE TRIPPED THEN IT GREW THICK OF SOUND THEN HIS HEAD WAGGED FROM SIDE TO SIDE UNTIL AT LAST HE FELL ASLEEP AS THOUGH HE NEVER WOULD WAKEN AGAIN THEN ROBIN HOOD LAUGHED ALOUD AND QUICKLY TOOK THE WARRANT FROM OUT THE TINKERS POUCH WITH HIS DEFT FINGERS SLY ART THOU TINKER QUOTH HE BUT NOT YET I BOW ART THOU AS SLY AS THAT SAME SLY THIEF ROBIN HOOD THEN HE CALLED THE HOST TO HIM AND SAID HERE

HIMSELF SHALL KNOW OF THIS AND HOW HIS LAWS ARE PERVERTED AND DESPISED BY THIS BAND OF REBEL OUTLAWS AS FOR YON TRAITOR TINKER HIM WILL I HANG IF I CATCH HIM UPON THE VERY HIGHEST GALLOWS TREE IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE THEN HE BADE ALL HIS SERVANTS AND RETAINERS TO MAKE READY TO GO TO LONDON TOWN TO SEE AND SPEAK WITH THE KING AT THIS THERE WAS BUSTLING AT THE SHERIFFS CASTLE AND MEN RAN HITHER AND THITHER UPON THIS BUSINESS AND UPON THAT WHILE THE FORGE FIRES OF NOTTINGHAM GLOWED RED FAR INTO THE NIGHT LIKE TWINKLING STARS FOR ALL THE SMITHS OF THE TOWN WERE BUSY MAKING OR MENDING ARMOR FOR THE

THIEVING KNAVES IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WHEN THE FLOOD COMETH IT SWEEPETH AWAY GRAIN AS WELL AS CHAFF THEN THE SHERIFF TURNED AWAY WITH A SORE AND TROUBLED HEART AND SADLY HE RUED HIS FINE SHOW OF RETAINERS FOR HE SAW THAT THE KING WAS ANGRY BECAUSE HE HAD SO MANY MEN ABOUT HIM AND YET COULD NOT ENFORCE THE LAWS SO AS THEY ALL RODE SLOWLY BACK TO NOTTINGHAM THE SHERIFF WAS THOUGHTFUL AND FULL OF CARE NOT A WORD DID HE SPEAK TO ANYONE AND NO ONE OF HIS MEN SPOKE TO HIM BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS BUSY DEVISING SOME PLAN TO TAKE ROBIN HOOD AHA CRIED HE SUDDENLY SMITING HIS HAND UPON HIS THIGH I

OVERPERSUADED BY HIS SPIRIT TO COME TO THE BUTTS AND IT WAS THIS THOUGHT WHICH CAUSED HIM TO CRY AHA AND SMITE HIS PALM UPON HIS THIGH SO AS SOON AS HE HAD RETURNED SAFELY TO NOTTINGHAM HE SENT MESSENGERS NORTH AND SOUTH AND EAST AND WEST TO PROCLAIM THROUGH TOWN HAMLET AND COUNTRYSIDE THIS GRAND SHOOTING MATCH AND EVERYONE WAS BIDDEN THAT COULD DRAW A LONGBOW AND THE PRIZE WAS TO BE AN

THE SHERIFF AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED WITH ANGER AND BY MY FAITH AND TROTH I HAVE A GOOD PART OF A MIND TO HAVE THEE BEATEN FOR THINE INSOLENCE THEN HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND STRODE AWAY IT WAS A RIGHT MOTLEY COMPANY THAT GATHERED ABOUT THE NOBLE GREENWOOD TREE IN SHERWOODS DEPTHS THAT SAME DAY A SCORE AND MORE OF BAREFOOT FRIARS WERE THERE AND SOME THAT LOOKED LIKE TINKERS AND SOME THAT SEEMED TO BE STURDY BEGGARS AND RUSTIC HINDS AND SEATED UPON A MOSSY COUCH WAS ONE ALL CLAD IN TATTERED SCARLET WITH A PATCH OVER ONE EYE AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD THE GOLDEN ARROW THAT WAS THE PRIZE OF THE GREAT SHOOTING MATCH THEN AMIDST A NOISE OF TALKING AND LAUGHTER HE TOOK THE PATCH FROM OFF HIS EYE AND STRIPPED AWAY THE SCARLET RAGS FROM OFF HIS BODY AND SHOWED HIMSELF ALL CLOTHED IN FAIR LINCOLN GREEN AND QUOTH HE EASY COME THESE THINGS AWAY BUT WALNUT STAIN COMETH NOT SO SPEEDILY FROM YELLOW HAIR THEN ALL LAUGHED LOUDER THAN BEFORE FOR IT WAS ROBIN HOOD HIMSELF THAT HAD WON THE PRIZE FROM THE SHERIFFS VERY HANDS THEN ALL SAT DOWN TO THE WOODLAND FEAST AND TALKEDAMONG THEMSELVES OF THE MERRY JEST THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON THE SHERIFF AND OF THE ADVENTURES THAT HAD BEFALLEN EACH MEMBER OF THE BAND IN HIS DISGUISE BUT WHEN THE FEAST WAS DONE ROBIN HOOD TOOK LITTLE JOHN APART AND SAID TRULY AM I VEXED IN MY BLOOD FOR I HEARD THE SHERIFF SAY TODAY THOU SHOOTEST BETTER THAN THAT COWARD KNAVE ROBIN HOOD THAT DARED NOT SHOW HIS FACE HERE THIS DAY I WOULD FAIN LET HIM KNOW WHO IT WAS WHO WON THE GOLDEN ARROW FROM OUT HIS HAND AND ALSO THAT I AM NO COWARD SUCH AS HE TAKES ME TO BE THEN LITTLE JOHN SAID GOOD MASTER TAKE THOU ME AND WILL STUTELY AND WE WILL SEND YON FAT SHERIFF NEWS OF ALL THIS BY A MESSENGER SUCH AS HE DOTH NOT EXPECT THAT DAY THE SHERIFF SAT AT MEAT IN THE GREAT HALL OF HIS HOUSE AT NOTTINGHAM TOWN LONG TABLES STOOD DOWN THE HALL AT WHICH SAT MEN AT ARMS AND HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS AND GOOD STOUT VILLAINS IN ALL FOURSCORE AND MORE THERE THEY TALKED OF THE DAYS SHOOTING AS THEY ATE THEIR MEAT AND QUAFFED THEIR ALE THE SHERIFF SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE UPON A RAISED SEAT UNDER A CANOPY AND BESIDE HIM SAT HIS DAME BOND SERVANTS BY MY TROTH SAID HE I DID RECKON FULL ROUNDLY THAT THAT KNAVE ROBIN HOOD WOULD BE AT THE GAME TODAY I DID NOT THINK THAT HE WAS SUCH A COWARD BUT WHO COULD THAT SAUCY KNAVE BE WHO ANSWERED ME TO MY BEARD SO BRAVELY I WONDER THAT I DID NOT HAVE HIM BEATEN BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS THAN RAGS AND TATTERS THEN EVEN AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING SOMETHING FELL RATTLING AMONG THE DISHES ON THE TABLE WHILE THOSE THAT SATNEAR STARTED UP WONDERING WHAT IT MIGHT BE AFTER A WHILE ONE OF THE MEN AT ARMS GATHERED COURAGE ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP AND BRING IT TO THE SHERIFF THEN EVERYONE SAW THAT IT WAS A BLUNTED GRAY GOOSE SHAFT WITH A FINE SCROLL ABOUT THE THICKNESS OF A GOOSE QUILL TIED NEAR TO ITS HEAD THE SHERIFF OPENED THE SCROLL AND GLANCED AT IT WHILE THE VEINS UPON HIS FOREHEAD SWELLED AND HIS CHEEKS GREW RUDDY WITH RAGE AS HE READ FOR THIS WAS WHAT HE SAW NOW HEAVEN BLESS THY GRACE THIS DAY SAY ALL IN SWEET SHERWOOD FOR THOU DIDST GIVE THE PRIZE AWAY TO MERRY ROBIN HOOD WHENCE CAME THIS CRIED THE SHERIFF IN A MIGHTY VOICE EVEN THROUGH THE WINDOW YOUR WORSHIP QUOTH THE MAN WHO HAD HANDED THE SHAFT TO HIMWILL STUTELY RESCUED BY HIS COMPANIONS NOW WHEN THE SHERIFF FOUND THAT NEITHER LAW NOR GUILE COULD OVERCOME ROBIN HOOD HE WAS MUCH PERPLEXED AND SAID TO HIMSELF FOOL THAT I AM HAD I NOT TOLD OUR KING OF ROBIN HOOD I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN MYSELF INTO SUCH A COIL BUT NOW I MUST EITHER TAKE HIM CAPTIVE OR HAVE WRATH VISITED UPON MY HEAD FROM HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY I HAVE TRIED LAW AND I HAVE TRIED GUILE AND I HAVE FAILED IN BOTH SO I WILL TRY WHAT MAY BE DONE WITH MIGHT THUS COMMUNING WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED HIS CONSTABLES TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND NOW TAKE YE EACH FOUR MEN ALL ARMED IN PROOF SAID HE AND GET YE GONE TO THE FOREST AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND LIE IN WAIT FOR THIS SAME ROBIN HOOD BUT IF ANY CONSTABLE FINDS TOO MANY MEN AGAINST HIM LET HIM SOUND A HORN AND THEN LET EACH BAND WITHIN HEARING COME WITH ALL SPEED AND JOIN THE PARTY THAT CALLS THEM THUS I THINK SHALL WE TAKE THIS GREEN CLAD KNAVE FURTHERMORE TO HIM THAT FIRST MEETETH WITH ROBIN HOOD SHALL ONE HUNDRED POUNDS OF SILVER MONEY BE GIVEN IF HE BE BROUGHT TO ME DEAD OR ALIVE AND TO HIM THAT MEETETH WITH ANY OF HIS BAND SHALL TWOSCORE POUNDS BE GIVEN IF SUCH BE BROUGHT TO ME DEAD OR ALIVE SO BE YE BOLD AND BE YE CRAFTYSO THUS THEY WENT IN THREESCORE COMPANIES OF FIVE TO SHERWOOD FOREST TO TAKE ROBIN HOOD EACH CONSTABLE WISHING THAT HE MIGHT BE THE ONE TO FIND THE BOLD OUTLAW OR AT LEAST ONE OF HIS BAND FOR SEVEN DAYS AND NIGHTS THEY HUNTED THROUGH THE FOREST GLADES BUT NEVER SAW SO MUCH AS A SINGLE MAN IN LINCOLN GREEN FOR TIDINGS OF ALL THIS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD BY TRUSTY EADOM O THE BLUE BOAR WHEN HE FIRST HEARD THE NEWS ROBIN SAID IF THE SHERIFF DARE SEND FORCE TO MEET FORCE WOE WILL IT BE FOR HIM AND MANY A BETTER MAN BESIDES FOR BLOOD WILL FLOW AND THERE WILL BE GREAT TROUBLE FOR ALL BUT FAIN WOULD I SHUN BLOOD AND BATTLE AND FAIN WOULD I NOT DEAL SORROW TO WOMENFOLK AND WIVES BECAUSE GOOD STOUT YEOMEN LOSE THEIR LIVES ONCE I SLEW A MAN AND NEVER DO I WISH TO SLAY A MAN AGAIN FOR IT IS BITTER FOR THE SOUL TO THINK THEREON SO NOW WE WILL ABIDE SILENTLY IN SHERWOOD FOREST SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL FOR ALL BUT SHOULD WE BE FORCED TO DEFEND OURSELVES OR ANY OF OUR BAND THEN LET EACH MAN DRAW BOW AND BRAND WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AT THIS SPEECH MANY OF THE BAND SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND SAID TO THEMSELVES NOW THE SHERIFF WILL THINK THAT WE ARE COWARDS AND FOLK WILL SCOFF THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE SAYING THAT WE FEAR TO MEET THESE MEN BUT THEY SAID NOTHING ALOUD SWALLOWING THEIR WORDS AND DOING AS ROBIN BADE THEM THUS THEY HID IN THE DEPTHS OF SHERWOOD FOREST FOR SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS AND NEVER SHOWED THEIR FACES ABROAD IN ALL THAT TIME BUT EARLY IN THE MORNING OF THE EIGHTH DAY ROBIN HOOD CALLED THE BAND TOGETHER AND SAID NOW WHOWILL GO AND FIND WHAT THE SHERIFFS MEN ARE AT BY THIS TIME FOR I KNOW RIGHT WELL THEY WILL NOT BIDE FOREVER WITHIN SHERWOOD SHADES AT THIS A GREAT SHOUT AROSE AND EACH MAN WAVED HIS BOW ALOFT AND CRIED THAT HE MIGHT BE THE ONE TO GO THEN ROBIN HOODS HEART WAS PROUD WHEN HE LOOKED AROUND ON HIS STOUT BRAVE FELLOWS AND HE SAID BRAVE AND TRUE ARE YE ALL MY MERRY MEN AND A RIGHT STOUT BAND OF GOOD FELLOWS ARE YE BUT YE CANNOT ALL GO SO I WILL CHOOSE ONE FROM AMONG YOU AND IT SHALL BE GOOD WILL STUTELY FOR HE IS AS SLY AS EER AN OLD DOG FOX IN SHERWOOD FOREST THEN WILL STUTELY LEAPED HIGH ALOFT AND LAUGHED LOUDLY CLAPPING HIS HANDS FOR PURE JOY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN

HE HUNG A GOOD BROADSWORD IN SUCH A PLACE THAT HE COULD EASILY LAY HANDS UPON IT THUS CLAD HE SET FORTH UPON HIS QUEST UNTIL HE CAME TO THE VERGE OF THE FOREST AND SO TO THE HIGHWAY HE SAW TWO BANDS OF THE SHERIFFS MEN YET HE TURNED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR THE LEFT BUT ONLY DREW HIS COWL THE CLOSER OVER HIS FACE FOLDING HIS HANDS AS IF IN MEDITATION SO AT LAST HE CAME TO THE SIGN OF THE BLUE BOAR FOR QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF OUR GOOD FRIEND EADOM WILL TELL ME ALL THE NEWS AT THE SIGN OF THE BLUE BOAR HE FOUND A BAND OF THE SHERIFFS MEN DRINKING RIGHT LUSTILY SO WITHOUT SPEAKING TO ANYONE HE SAT DOWN UPON A DISTANT BENCH HIS STAFF IN HIS HAND ANDHIS HEAD BOWED FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WERE MEDITATING THUS HE SAT WAITING UNTIL HE MIGHT SEE THE LANDLORD APART AND EADOM DID NOT KNOW HIM BUT THOUGHT HIM TO BE SOME POOR TIRED FRIAR SO HE LET HIM SIT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HIM OR MOLESTING HIM THOUGH HE LIKED NOT THE CLOTH FOR SAID HE TO HIMSELF IT IS A HARD HEART THAT KICKS THE LAME DOG FROM OFF THE SILL AS STUTELY SAT THUS THERE CAME A GREAT HOUSE CAT AND RUBBED AGAINST HIS KNEE RAISING HIS ROBE A PALMSBREADTH HIGH STUTELY PUSHED HIS ROBE QUICKLY DOWN AGAIN BUT THE CONSTABLE WHO COMMANDED THE SHERIFFS MEN SAW WHAT HAD PASSED AND SAW ALSO FAIR LINCOLN GREEN BENEATH THE FRIARS ROBE HE SAID NOTHING AT THE TIME BUT COMMUNED WITHIN HIMSELF IN THIS WISE YON IS NO FRIAR OF ORDERS GRAY AND ALSO I WOT NO HONEST YEOMAN GOETH ABOUT IN PRIESTS GARB NOR DOTH A THIEF GO SO FOR NOUGHT NOW I THINK IN GOOD SOOTH THAT IS ONE OF ROBIN HOODS OWN MEN SO PRESENTLY HE SAID ALOUD O HOLY FATHER WILT THOU NOT TAKE A GOOD POT OF MARCH BEER TO SLAKE THY THIRSTY SOUL WITHAL BUT STUTELY SHOOK HIS HEAD SILENTLY FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF MAYBE THERE BE THOSE HERE WHO KNOW MY VOICE THEN THE CONSTABLE

NOTTINGHAM THOSE IN AUTHORITY BEING VERY WROTH WITH HIM BUT THOUGH THEY DID NOT GO ABROAD THEY LIVED A MERRY LIFE WITHIN THE WOODLANDS SPENDING THE DAYS IN SHOOTING AT GARLANDS HUNG UPON A WILLOW WAND

AT FIRST HE HAD A GREAT PART OF A MIND NOT TO PROCLAIM THE FAIR BUT SECOND THOUGHT TOLD HIM THAT MEN WOULD LAUGH AT HIM AND SAY AMONG THEMSELVES THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF ROBIN HOOD SO HE PUT THAT THOUGHT BY AT LAST HE FIXED IN HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD OFFER SUCH A PRIZE AS THEY WOULDNOT CARE TO SHOOT FOR AT SUCH TIMES IT HAD BEEN THE CUSTOM TO OFFER A HALF SCORE OF MARKS OR A TUN OF ALE SO THIS YEAR HE PROCLAIMED THAT A PRIZE OF TWO FAT STEERS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE BEST BOWMAN WHEN ROBIN HOOD HEARD WHAT HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED HE WAS VEXED AND SAID NOW BESHREW THIS SHERIFF THAT HE SHOULD OFFER SUCH A

SO HE CAME FORTH AS IF HE WOULD SAY WATCH GOOD PEOPLE HOW THAT I CARVE YOU THIS COCKEREL RIGHT SPEEDILY BUT HE PRESENTLY FOUND IT TO BE NO SUCH SPEEDY MATTER RIGHT DEFTLY HE STRUCK AND WITH GREAT SKILL OF FENCE BUT HE HAD FOUND HIS MATCH IN LITTLE JOHN ONCE TWICE THRICE HE STRUCK AND THREE TIMES LITTLE JOHN TURNED THE BLOWS TO THE LEFT HAND AND TO THE RIGHT THEN QUICKLY AND WITH A DAINTY BACKHANDED BLOW HE RAPPED ERIC BENEATH HIS GUARD SO SHREWDLY THAT IT MADE HIS HEAD RING AGAIN THEN ERIC STEPPED BACK TO GATHER HIS WITS WHILE A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP AND ALL WERE GLAD THAT NOTTINGHAM HAD CRACKED LINCOLNS CROWN AND THUS ENDED THE FIRST BOUT OF THE GAME THEN PRESENTLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE SPORT CRIED PLAY AND THEY CAME TOGETHER AGAIN BUT NOW ERIC PLAYED WARILY FOR HE FOUND HIS MAN WAS OF RIGHT GOOD METTLE AND ALSO HE HAD NO SWEET MEMORY OF THE BLOW THAT HE HAD GOT SO THIS BOUT NEITHER LITTLE JOHN NOR THE LINCOLN MAN CAUGHT A STROKE WITHIN HIS GUARD THEN AFTER A WHILE THEY PARTED AGAIN AND THIS MADE THE SECOND BOUTTHEN FOR THE THIRD TIME THEY CAME TOGETHER AND AT FIRST ERIC STROVE TO BE WARY AS HE HAD BEEN BEFORE BUT GROWING MAD AT FINDING HIMSELF SO FOILED HE LOST HIS WITS AND BEGAN TO RAIN BLOWS SO FIERCELY AND SO FAST THAT THEY RATTLED LIKE HAIL ON PENTHOUSE ROOF BUT IN SPITE OF ALL HE DID NOT REACH WITHIN LITTLE JOHNS GUARD THEN AT LAST LITTLE JOHN SAW HIS CHANCE AND SEIZED IT RIGHT CLEVERLY ONCE MORE WITH A QUICK BLOW HE RAPPED ERIC BESIDE THE HEAD AND ERE HE COULD REGAIN HIMSELF LITTLE JOHN SLIPPED HIS RIGHT HAND DOWN TO HIS LEFT AND WITH A SWINGING BLOW SMOTE THE OTHER SO SORELY UPON THE CROWN THAT DOWN HE FELL AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER MOVE AGAIN THEN THE PEOPLE SHOUTED SO LOUD THAT FOLK CAME RUNNING FROM ALL ABOUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE ADO WHILE LITTLE JOHN LEAPED DOWN FROM THE STAND AND GAVE THE STAFF BACK TO HIM THAT HAD LENT IT TO HIM AND THUS ENDED THE FAMOUS BOUT BETWEEN LITTLE JOHN AND ERIC O LINCOLN OF GREAT RENOWN BUT NOW THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THOSE WHO WERE TO SHOOT WITH THE LONGBOW WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACES SO THE PEOPLE BEGAN FLOCKING TO THE BUTTS WHERE THE SHOOTING WAS TO BE NEAR THE TARGET IN A GOOD PLACE SAT THE SHERIFF UPON A RAISED DAIS WITH MANY GENTLEFOLK AROUND HIM WHEN THE ARCHERS HAD TAKEN THEIR PLACES THE HERALD CAME FORWARD AND PROCLAIMED THE RULES OF THE GAME AND HOW EACH SHOULD SHOOT THREE SHOTS AND TO HIM THAT SHOULD SHOOT THE BEST THE PRIZE OF TWO FAT STEERS WAS TO BELONG A SCORE OF BRAVE SHOTS WERE GATHERED THERE AND AMONG THEM SOME OF THE KEENEST HANDS AT THE LONGBOW IN LINCOLN AND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND AMONG THEM LITTLE JOHN STOOD TALLER THAN ALL THE REST WHOIS YON STRANGER CLAD ALL IN SCARLET SAID SOME AND OTHERS ANSWERED IT IS HE THAT HATH BUT NOW SO SOUNDLY CRACKED THE CROWN OF ERIC O LINCOLN THUS THE PEOPLE TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES UNTIL AT LAST IT REACHED EVEN THE SHERIFFS EARS AND NOW EACH MAN STEPPED FORWARD AND SHOT IN TURN BUT THOUGH EACH SHOT WELL LITTLE JOHN WAS THE BEST OF ALL FOR THREE TIMES HE STRUCK THE CLOUT AND ONCE ONLY THE LENGTH OF A BARLEYCORN FROM THE CENTER HEY FOR THE TALL ARCHER SHOUTED THE CROWD AND SOME AMONG THEM SHOUTED HEY FOR REYNOLD GREENLEAF FOR THIS WAS THE NAME THAT LITTLE JOHN HAD CALLED HIMSELF THAT DAY THEN THE SHERIFF STEPPED DOWN FROM THE RAISED SEAT AND CAME TO WHERE THE ARCHERS STOOD WHILE ALL DOFFED THEIR CAPS THAT SAW HIM COMING HE LOOKED KEENLY AT LITTLE JOHN BUT DID NOT KNOW HIM THOUGH HE SAID AFTER A WHILE HOW NOW GOOD FELLOW METHINKS THERE IS THAT ABOUT THY FACE THAT I HAVE SEEN EREWHILE MAYHAP IT MAY BE SO QUOTH LITTLE JOHN FOR OFTEN HAVE I SEEN YOUR WORSHIP AND AS HE SPOKE HE LOOKED STEADILY INTO THE SHERIFFS EYES SO THAT THE LATTER DID NOT SUSPECT WHO HE WAS A BRAVE BLADE ART THOU GOOD FRIEND SAID THE SHERIFF AND I HEAR

BEER FOR JOY OF HAVING GOTTEN SUCH A MAN FOR I WOT THOU SHOOTEST AS FAIR A SHAFT AS ROBIN HOOD HIMSELF THEN SAID LITTLE JOHN FOR JOY OF HAVING GOTTEN MYSELF INTO THY SERVICE I WILL GIVE FAT STEERS AND BROWN ALE TO ALL THESE GOOD FOLK TO MAKE THEM MERRY WITHAL AT THIS AROSE A GREAT SHOUT MANY CASTING THEIR CAPS ALOFT FOR JOY OF THE GIFT THEN SOME BUILT GREAT FIRES AND ROASTED THE STEERS AND OTHERS BROACHED THE BUTT OF ALE WITH WHICH ALL MADE THEMSELVES MERRY THEN WHEN THEY HAD EATEN AND DRUNK AS MUCH AS THEY COULD AND WHEN THE DAY FADED AND THE GREAT MOON AROSE ALL RED AND ROUND OVER THE SPIRES AND TOWERS OF NOTTINGHAM TOWN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED AROUND THE FIRES TO THE MUSIC OF BAGPIPES AND HARPS BUT LONG BEFORE THIS MERRYMAKING HAD BEGUN THE SHERIFF AND HIS NEW SERVANT REYNOLD GREENLEAF WERE IN THE CASTLE OF NOTTINGHAMHOW LITTLE JOHN LIVED AT THE SHERIFFS THUS LITTLE JOHN ENTERED INTO THE SHERIFFS SERVICE AND FOUND THE LIFE HE LED THERE EASY ENOUGH FOR THE SHERIFF MADE HIM HIS RIGHT HAND MAN AND HELD HIM IN GREAT FAVOR HE SAT NIGH THE SHERIFF AT MEAT AND HE RAN BESIDE HIS HORSE WHEN HE WENT A HUNTING SO THAT WHAT WITH HUNTING AND HAWKING A LITTLE AND EATING RICH DISHES AND DRINKING GOOD SACK AND SLEEPING UNTIL LATE HOURS IN THE MORNING HE GREW AS FAT AS A STALL FED OX THUS THINGS FLOATED EASILY ALONG WITH THE TIDE UNTIL ONE DAY WHEN THE SHERIFF WENT A HUNTING THERE HAPPENED THAT WHICH BROKE THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF THINGS THIS MORNING THE SHERIFF AND MANY OF HIS MEN SET FORTH TO MEET CERTAIN LORDS TO GO A HUNTING HE LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM FOR HIS GOOD MAN REYNOLD GREENLEAF BUT NOT FINDING HIM WAS VEXED FOR HE WISHED TO SHOW LITTLE JOHNS SKILL TO HIS NOBLE FRIENDS AS FOR LITTLE JOHN HE LAY ABED SNORING LUSTILY TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS AT LAST HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM BUT DID NOT MOVE TO ARISE BRIGHTLY SHONE THE SUN IN AT THE WINDOW AND ALL THE AIR WAS SWEET WITH THE SCENT OF WOODBINE THAT HUNG IN SPRAYS ABOUT THE WALL WITHOUT FOR THE COLD WINTER WAS PAST AND SPRING WAS COME AGAIN AND LITTLE JOHN LAY STILL THINKING HOW SWEET WAS EVERYTHING ON THIS FAIR MORN JUST THEN HE HEARD FAINT AND FAR AWAY A DISTANT BUGLE NOTE SOUNDING THIN AND CLEAR THE SOUND WAS SMALL BUT LIKE A LITTLE PEBBLE DROPPED INTO A GLASSY FOUNTAIN IT BROKE ALL THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF HIS THOUGHTS UNTIL HIS WHOLE SOUL WAS FILLED WITH DISTURBANCE HIS SPIRIT SEEMED TO AWAKEN FROM ITS SLUGGISHNESS AND HIS MEMORY BROUGHT BACK TO HIM ALL THE MERRY GREENWOOD LIFE HOW THE BIRDS WERE SINGING BLITHELY THERE THIS BRIGHT MORNING AND HOW HIS LOVED COMPANIONS AND FRIENDS WERE FEASTING AND MAKING MERRY OR PERHAPS TALKING OF HIM WITH SOBER SPEECH FOR WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED THE SHERIFFS SERVICE HE DID SO IN JEST BUT THE HEARTHSTONE WAS WARM DURING THE WINTER AND THE FARE WAS FULL AND SO HE HAD ABIDED PUTTING OFF FROM DAY TO DAY HIS GOING BACK TO SHERWOOD UNTIL SIX LONG MONTHS HAD PASSED BUT NOW HE THOUGHT OF HIS GOOD MASTER AND OF WILL STUTELY WHOM HE LOVED BETTER THAN ANYONE IN ALL THE WORLD AND OF YOUNG DAVID OF DONCASTER WHOM HE HAD TRAINED SO WELL IN ALL MANLY SPORTS TILL THERE CAME OVER HIS HEART A GREAT AND BITTER LONGING FOR THEM ALL SO THAT HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS THEN HE SAID ALOUD HERE I GROW FAT LIKE A STALL FED OX AND ALL MY MANLINESS DEPARTETH FROM ME WHILE I BECOME A SLUGGARD AND DOLT BUT I WILL AROUSE ME AND GO BACK TO MINE OWN DEAR FRIENDS ONCE MORE AND NEVER WILL I LEAVE THEM AGAIN TILL LIFE DOTH LEAVE MY LIPS SO SAYING HE LEAPED FROM BED FOR HE HATED HIS SLUGGISHNESS NOW WHEN HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS HE SAW THE STEWARD STANDING NEAR THE PANTRY DOOR A GREAT FAT MAN WITH A HUGE BUNDLE OF KEYS HANGING TO HIS GIRDLE THEN LITTLE JOHN SAID HOMASTER STEWARD A HUNGRY MAN AM I FOR NOUGHT HAVE I HAD FOR ALL THIS BLESSED MORN THEREFORE GIVE ME TO EAT THEN THE STEWARD LOOKED GRIMLY AT HIM AND RATTLED THE KEYS IN HIS GIRDLE FOR HE HATED LITTLE JOHN BECAUSE HE HAD FOUND FAVOR WITH THE SHERIFF SO MASTER REYNOLD GREENLEAF THOU ART ANHUNGERED ART THOU QUOTH HE BUT FAIR YOUTH IF THOU LIVEST LONG ENOUGH THOU WILT FIND THAT HE WHO GETTETH OVERMUCH SLEEP FOR AN IDLE HEAD GOETH WITH AN EMPTY STOMACH FOR WHAT SAYETH THE OLD SAW MASTER

AY MARRY THAT WILL I RIGHT QUICKLY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A RAGE AND SO SAYING HE STRODE TO THE PANTRY AND TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT FOUND IT LOCKED WHEREAT THE STEWARD LAUGHED AND RATTLED HIS KEYS THEN THE WRATH OF LITTLE JOHN BOILED OVER AND LIFTING HIS CLENCHED FIST HE SMOTE THE PANTRY DOOR BURSTING OUT THREE PANELS AND MAKING SO LARGE ANOPENING THAT HE COULD EASILY STOOP AND WALK THROUGH IT WHEN THE STEWARD SAW WHAT WAS DONE HE WAXED MAD WITH RAGE AND AS LITTLE JOHN STOOPED TO LOOK WITHIN THE PANTRY HE SEIZED HIM FROM BEHIND BY THE NAPE OF THE NECK PINCHING HIM SORELY AND SMITING HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH HIS KEYS TILL THE YEOMANS EARS RANG AGAIN AT THIS LITTLE JOHN TURNED UPON THE STEWARD AND SMOTE HIM SUCH A BUFFET THAT THE FAT MAN FELL TO THE FLOOR AND LAY THERE AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER MOVE AGAIN THERE QUOTH LITTLE JOHN THINK WELL OF THAT STROKE AND NEVER KEEP A GOOD BREAKFAST FROM A HUNGRY MAN AGAIN SO SAYING HE CREPT INTO THE PANTRY AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND SOMETHING TO APPEASE HIS HUNGER HE SAW A GREAT VENISON PASTY AND TWO ROASTED CAPONS BESIDE WHICH WAS A PLATTER OF PLOVERS EGGS MOREOVER THERE WAS A FLASK OF SACK AND ONE OF CANARY A SWEET SIGHT TO A HUNGRY MAN THESE HE TOOK DOWN FROM THE SHELVES AND PLACED UPON A SIDEBOARD AND PREPARED TO MAKE HIMSELF MERRY NOW THE COOK IN THE KITCHEN ACROSS THE COURTYARD HEARD THE LOUD TALKING BETWEEN LITTLE JOHN AND THE STEWARD AND ALSO THE BLOW THAT LITTLE JOHN STRUCK THE OTHER SO HE CAME RUNNING ACROSS THE COURT AND UP THE STAIRWAY TO WHERE THE STEWARDS PANTRY WAS BEARING IN HIS HANDS THE SPIT WITH THE ROAST STILL UPON IT MEANWHILE THE STEWARD HAD GATHERED HIS WITS ABOUT HIM AND RISEN TO HIS FEET SO THAT WHEN THE COOK CAME TO THE STEWARDS PANTRY HE SAW HIM GLOWERING THROUGH THE BROKEN DOOR AT LITTLE JOHN WHO WAS MAKING READY FOR A GOOD REPAST AS ONE DOG GLOWERS AT ANOTHER THAT HAS A BONE WHEN THE STEWARD SAW THE COOKHE CAME TO HIM AND PUTTING ONE ARM OVER HIS SHOULDER ALAS SWEET FRIEND

BY HIS SIDE WHEREUPON THE STEWARD LEFT AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD FOR HE HATED THE SIGHT OF NAKED STEEL THEN THE COOK WALKED STRAIGHTWAY TO THE BROKEN PANTRY DOOR THROUGH WHICH HE SAW LITTLE JOHN TUCKING A NAPKIN BENEATH HIS CHIN AND PREPARING TO MAKE HIMSELF MERRY WHY HOW NOW REYNOLD GREENLEAF SAID THE COOK THOU ART NO BETTER THAN A THIEF I WOT COME THOU STRAIGHT FORTH MAN OR I WILL CARVE THEE AS I

CERTAIN FIGHT THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THEIR MASTER AND HIMSELF THROUGH WHICH THEY FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED NAY QUOTH ROBIN HOOD LAUGHING LOUDER THAN ALL HEAVEN FORBID THAT I SHOULD DOUBT THEE FOR I CARE FOR NO TASTE OF THY STAFF MYSELF LITTLE JOHN I MUST NEEDS OWN THAT THERE ARE THOSE OF MY BAND CAN HANDLE A SEVEN FOOT STAFF MORE DEFTLY THAN I YET NO MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE CAN DRAW GRAYGOOSE SHAFT WITH MY FINGERS NEVERTHELESS A JOURNEY TO ANCASTER MAY NOT BE ILL FOR THEE SO GO THOU AS I BID AND THOU HADST BEST GO THIS VERY EVENING FOR SINCE THOU HAST ABIDED AT THE SHERIFFS MANY KNOW THY FACE AND IF THOU GOEST IN BROAD DAYLIGHT THOU MAYST GET THYSELF INTO A COIL WITH SOME OF HIS WORSHIPS MEN AT ARMS BIDE THOU HERE TILL I BRING THEE MONEY TO PAY OUR GOOD HUGH I WARRANT HE HATH NO BETTER CUSTOMERS IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE THAN WE SO SAYING ROBIN LEFT THEM AND ENTERED THE FOREST NOT FAR FROM THE TRYSTING TREE WAS A GREAT ROCK IN WHICH A CHAMBER HAD BEEN HEWN THE ENTRANCE BEING BARRED BY A MASSIVE OAKEN DOOR TWO PALMS BREADTH IN THICKNESS STUDDED ABOUT WITH SPIKES AND FASTENED WITH A GREAT PADLOCK THIS WAS THE TREASURE HOUSE OF THE BAND AND THITHER ROBIN HOOD WENT AND UNLOCKING THE DOOR ENTERED THE CHAMBER FROM WHICH HE BROUGHT FORTH A BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE GAVE TO LITTLE JOHN TO PAY HUGH LONGSHANKS WITHAL FOR THE CLOTH OF LINCOLN GREEN THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM HE STRAPPED A GIRDLE ABOUT HIS LOINS TOOK A STOUT PIKESTAFF FULL SEVEN FEET LONG IN HIS HAND AND SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY SO HE STRODE WHISTLING ALONG THE LEAFY FOREST PATH THAT LED TO FOSSE WAY TURNING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT HAND NOR THE LEFT UNTIL AT LAST HE CAME TO WHERE THE PATH BRANCHED LEADING ON THE ONE HAND ONWARD TO FOSSE WAY AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWNAND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER THERE LIES THE WAY TO ANCASTER AND THE DUTY THOU ART SENT UPON NOW THE FIRST OF THESE TWO VOICES WAS FAR THE LOUDER FOR LITTLE JOHN HAD GROWN PASSING FOND OF GOOD LIVING THROUGH ABIDING AT THE SHERIFFS HOUSE SO PRESENTLY LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE I FEAR ME IT WILL RAIN THIS EVENING SO ILL EEN STOP AT THE BLUE BOAR TILL IT PASSES BY FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT WHEN ONE WISHES TO DO A THING AS LITTLE JOHN DID ONE FINDS NO LACK OF REASONS FOR THE DOING FOUR MERRY WAGS WERE AT THE BLUE BOAR INN A BUTCHER A BEGGAR AND TWO BAREFOOT FRIARS LITTLE JOHN HEARD THEM SINGING FROM AFAR AS HE WALKED THROUGH THE HUSH OF THE MELLOW TWILIGHT THAT WAS NOW FALLING OVER HILL AND DALE RIGHT GLAD WERE THEY TO WELCOME SUCH A MERRY BLADE AS LITTLE JOHN FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTILTHE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE UP HE ROSE AT THE DAWN OF THE NEXT DAY AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAD HELD THE MID COUNTRY CHAMPION BELT FOR WRESTLING TILL THE GREAT ADAM O LINCOLN CAST HIM IN THE RING AND BROKE ONE OF HIS RIBS BUT AT QUARTERSTAFF HE HAD NEVER YET MET HIS MATCH IN ALL THE COUNTRY ABOUT BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW AND A SLY JAUNT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE MOON WAS FULL AND THE DUN DEER IN SEASON SO THAT THE KINGS RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLANDS HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE ACROSS THE TANNERS SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLYBE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF WHEN HE HAD COME TO THAT PART OF THE ROAD THAT CUT THROUGH A CORNER OF THE FOREST NO DOUBT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE DUN DEER ARE COMING FROM THE FOREST DEPTHS NIGHER TO THE OPEN MEADOW LANDS MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER EVEN WHEN HE COULD NOT TICKLE THEIR RIBS WITH A CLOTHYARD SHAFT ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN NOW AS LITTLE JOHN STEPPED BLITHELY ALONG THINKING OF NOTHING BUT OF SUCH THINGS AS THE SWEETNESS OF THE HAWTHORN BUDS THAT BEDECKED THE HEDGEROWS OR GAZING UPWARD AT THE LARK THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOODKINGS DUN DEER FOR BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY QUOTH HE AGAIN AFTER A TIME THIS MATTER MUST EEN BE LOOKED INTO SO QUITTING THE HIGHROAD HE ALSO ENTERED THE THICKETS AND BEGAN SPYING AROUND AFTER STOUT ARTHUR A BLAND SO FOR A LONG TIME THEY BOTH OF THEM WENT HUNTING ABOUT LITTLE JOHN AFTER THE TANNER AND THE TANNER AFTER THE DEER AT LAST LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER HILLOA QUOTH HE WHAT ART THOU DOING HERE THOU NAUGHTY FELLOW WHO ART THOU THAT COMEST RANGING SHERWOODS PATHS IN VERY SOOTH THOU HAST AN EVIL CAST OF COUNTENANCE AND I DO THINK TRULY THAT THOU ART NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMEST AFTER OUR GOOD KINGS DEER NAY QUOTH THE TANNER BOLDLY FOR THOUGH TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE FRIGHTENED BY BIG WORDS THOU LIEST IN THY TEETH I AM NO THIEF BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK NOW I HAVE A GREAT PART OF A MIND TO CRACK THY PATE FOR THEE I WOULD HAVE THEE KNOW FELLOW THAT I AM AS IT WERE ONE OF THE KINGS FORESTERS LEASTWISE MUTTERED HE TO HIMSELF I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OFOUR GOOD SOVEREIGNS DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY IS IT SO CRIED LITTLE JOHN IN A RAGE NOW BY MY FAITH THOU SAUCY ROGUE THY TONGUE HATH LED THEE INTO A PIT THOU WILT HAVE A SORRY TIME GETTING OUT OF FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NEER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN MARRY COME UP WITH A MURRAIN CRIED THE TANNER FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NEER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NEER I TANNED A CALFS HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE SPLIT MY STAFF INTO SKEWERS FOR LAMBS FLESH AND CALL ME NO MORE BRAVE MAN NOW LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW STAY SAID LITTLE JOHN LET US FIRST MEASURE OUR CUDGELS I DO RECKON MY STAFF LONGER THAN THINE AND I WOULD NOT TAKE VANTAGE OF THEE BY EVEN SO MUCH AS AN INCH NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRYCOMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES AS OF MEN IN A RAGE PASSING FELL WORDS BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHNS VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KINGS RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE THICKETS WHENCE THE VOICES CAME AND PUSHING ASIDE THE LEAVES PEEPED INTO THE LITTLE OPEN SPACE WHERE THE TWO MEN STAFF IN HAND WERE COMING SLOWLY TOGETHER HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHTENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN TWO DOGS THAT THINK TO FIGHT WALKING SLOWLY ROUND AND ROUND EACH OTHER NEITHER CUR WISHING TO BEGIN THE COMBAT SO THOSE TWO STOUT YEOMEN MOVED SLOWLY AROUND EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN THEN UP AND DOWN AND BACK AND FORTH THEY TROD THE BLOWS FALLING SO THICK AND FAST THAT AT A DISTANCE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HALF A SCORE OF MEN WERE FIGHTING THUS THEY FOUGHT FOR NIGH A HALF AN HOUR UNTIL THE GROUND WAS ALL PLOWED UP WITH THE DIGGING OF THEIR HEELS AND THEIR BREATHING GREW LABORED LIKE THE OX IN THE FURROW BUT LITTLE JOHN SUFFERED THE MOST FOR HE HAD BECOME UNUSED TO SUCH STIFF LABOR AND HIS JOINTS WERE NOT AS SUPPLE AS THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE HE WENT TO DWELL WITH THE SHERIFF ALL THIS TIME ROBIN HOOD LAY BENEATH THE BUSH REJOICING AT SUCH A COMELY BOUT OF QUARTERSTAFF BY MY FAITH QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE OVERCOME YON FELLOW BEFORE THIS HAD HE BEEN IN HIS FORMER TRIM AT LAST LITTLE JOHN SAW HIS CHANCE AND THROWING ALL THE STRENGTH HE FELT GOING FROM HIM INTO ONE BLOW THAT MIGHT HAVE FELLED AN OX HE STRUCK AT THE TANNER WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND NOW DID THE TANNERS COWHIDE CAP STAND HIM IN GOOD STEAD AND BUT FOR IT HE MIGHT NEVER HAVE HELD STAFF INHAND AGAIN AS IT WAS THE BLOW HE CAUGHT BESIDE THE HEAD WAS SO SHREWD THAT IT SENT HIM STAGGERING ACROSS THE LITTLE GLADE SO THAT IF LITTLE JOHN HAD HAD THE STRENGTH TO FOLLOW UP HIS VANTAGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ILL FOR STOUT ARTHUR BUT HE REGAINED HIMSELF QUICKLY AND AT ARMS LENGTH STRUCK BACK A BLOW AT LITTLE JOHN AND THIS TIME THE STROKE REACHED ITS MARK AND DOWN WENT LITTLE JOHN AT FULL LENGTH HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN WOULDST THOU STRIKE A MAN WHEN HE IS DOWN AY MARRY WOULD I QUOTH THE TANNER GIVING HIM ANOTHER THWACK WITH HIS STAFF STOP ROARED LITTLE JOHN HELP HOLD I SAY I YIELD ME I YIELD ME I SAY GOOD FELLOW HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE

AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN I TELL THEE GOOD FELLOW I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAYAND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED

PASSED AND THE TIME OF FALL HAD COME BRINGING WITH IT ITS OWN PLEASURES AND JOYOUSNESS FOR NOW WHEN THE HARVEST WAS GATHERED HOME MERRY BANDS OF GLEANERS ROAMED THE COUNTRY ABOUT SINGING ALONG THE

WILL SCATHELOCK MIDGE THE MILLERS SON AND OTHERS A SCORE OR MORE OF STOUT FELLOWS HAD ABIDED IN THE FOREST WITH FRIAR TUCK TO MAKE READY FOR THE HOMECOMING BUT ALL THE REST WERE GONE EITHER WITH ROBIN HOOD OR LITTLE JOHN THEY TRAVELED ONWARD ROBIN FOLLOWING HIS FANCY AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWING ROBIN NOW THEY WENDED THEIR WAY THROUGH AN OPEN DALE WITH COTTAGE AND FARM LYING THEREIN AND NOW AGAIN THEY ENTERED WOODLANDS ONCE MORE PASSING BY FAIR MANSFIELD TOWN WITH ITS TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS AND SPIRES ALL SMILING IN THE SUN THEY CAME AT LAST OUT OF THE FOREST LANDS ONWARD THEY JOURNEYED THROUGH HIGHWAY AND BYWAY THROUGH VILLAGES WHERE GOODWIVES AND MERRY LASSESPEEPED THROUGH THE CASEMENTS AT THE FINE SHOW OF YOUNG MEN UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME OVER BEYOND ALVERTON IN DERBYSHIRE BY THIS TIME HIGH NOONTIDE HAD COME YET THEY HAD MET NO GUEST SUCH AS WAS WORTH THEIR WHILE TO TAKE BACK TO SHERWOOD SO COMING AT LAST TO A CERTAIN SPOT WHERE A SHRINE STOOD AT THE CROSSING OF TWO ROADS ROBIN CALLED UPON THEM TO STOP FOR HERE ON EITHER SIDE WAS SHELTER OF HIGH HEDGEROWS BEHIND WHICH WAS GOOD HIDING WHENCE THEY COULD WATCH THE ROADS AT THEIR EASE WHILE THEY ATE THEIR MIDDAY MEAL QUOTH MERRY ROBIN HERE METHINKS IS GOOD LODGING WHERE PEACEFUL FOLK SUCH AS WE BE CAN EAT IN QUIETNESS THEREFORE WE WILL REST HERE AND SEE WHAT MAY PERCHANCE FALL INTO OUR LUCK POT SO THEY CROSSED A STILE AND CAME BEHIND A HEDGEROW WHERE THE MELLOW SUNLIGHT WAS BRIGHT AND WARM AND WHERE THE GRASS WAS SOFT AND THERE SAT THEM DOWN THEN EACH MAN DREW FROM THE POUCH THAT HUNG BESIDE HIM THAT WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT TO EAT FOR A MERRY WALK SUCH AS THIS HAD BEEN SHARPENS THE APPETITE TILL IT IS AS KEEN AS A MARCH WIND SO NO MORE WORDS WERE SPOKEN BUT EACH MAN SAVED HIS TEETH FOR BETTER USE MUNCHING AT BROWN CRUST AND COLD MEAT RIGHT LUSTILY IN FRONT OF THEM ONE OF THE HIGHROADS CRAWLED UP THE STEEP HILL AND THEN DIPPED SUDDENLY OVER ITS CREST SHARPCUT WITH HEDGEROW AND SHAGGY GRASS AGAINST THE SKY OVER THE TOP OF THE WINDY HILL PEEPED THE EAVES OF A FEW HOUSES OF THE VILLAGE THAT FELL BACK INTO THE VALLEY BEHIND THERE ALSO SHOWED THE TOP OF A WINDMILL THE SAILS SLOWLY RISING AND DIPPING FROM BEHIND THE HILL AGAINST THE CLEAR BLUE SKY AS THE LIGHT WIND MOVED THEM WITH CREAKING AND LABOREDSWING SO THE YEOMEN LAY BEHIND THE HEDGE AND FINISHED THEIR MIDDAY MEAL BUT STILL THE TIME SLIPPED ALONG AND NO ONE CAME AT LAST A MAN CAME SLOWLY RIDING OVER THE HILL AND DOWN THE STONY ROAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE ROBIN AND HIS BAND LAY HIDDEN HE WAS A GOOD STOUT KNIGHT BUT SORROWFUL OF FACE AND DOWNCAST OF MIEN HIS CLOTHES WERE PLAIN AND RICH BUT NO CHAIN OF GOLD SUCH AS FOLK OF HIS STAND IN LIFE WORE AT MOST TIMES HUNG AROUND HIS NECK AND NO JEWEL WAS ABOUT HIM YET NO ONE COULD MISTAKE HIM FOR AUGHT BUT ONE OF PROUD AND NOBLE BLOOD HIS HEAD WAS BOWED UPON HIS BREAST AND HIS HANDS DROOPED LIMP ON EITHER SIDE AND SO HE CAME SLOWLY RIDING AS THOUGH SUNK IN SAD THOUGHTS WHILE EVEN HIS GOOD HORSE THE REINS LOOSE UPON HIS NECK WALKED WITH HANGING HEAD AS THOUGH HE SHARED HIS MASTERS GRIEF QUOTH ROBIN HOOD YON IS VERILY A SORRY LOOKING GALLANT AND DOTH SEEM TO HAVE DONNED ILL CONTENT WITH

ROBIN TALKED SO QUAINTLY TO THE BISHOP AND THE KNIGHT THAT THE ONE FORGETTING HIS VEXATION AND THE OTHER HIS TROUBLES THEY BOTH LAUGHED ALOUD AGAIN AND AGAIN THEN ALLAN A DALE CAME FORTH AND TUNED HIS HARP AND ALL WAS HUSHED AROUND AND HE SANG IN HIS WONDROUS VOICE SONGS OF LOVE OF WAR OF GLORY AND OF SADNESS AND ALL LISTENED WITHOUT A MOVEMENT OR A SOUND SO ALLAN SANG TILL THE GREAT ROUND SILVER MOON GLEAMED WITH ITS CLEAR WHITE LIGHT AMID THE UPPER TANGLE OF THE MAZY BRANCHES OF THE TREES ATLAST TWO FELLOWS CAME TO SAY THAT THE FEAST WAS READY SPREAD SO ROBIN LEADING HIS GUESTS WITH EITHER HAND BROUGHT THEM TO WHERE GREAT SMOKING DISHES THAT SENT SAVORY SMELLS FAR AND NEAR STOOD ALONG THE WHITE LINEN CLOTH SPREAD ON THE GRASS ALL AROUND WAS A GLARE OF TORCHES THAT LIT EVERYTHING UP WITH A RED LIGHT THEN STRAIGHTWAY SITTING DOWN ALL FELL TO WITH NOISE AND HUBBUB THE RATTLING OF PLATTERS BLENDING WITH THE SOUND OF LOUD TALKING AND LAUGHTER A LONG TIME THE FEAST LASTED BUT AT LAST ALL

WERE TUMBLING ON THE GREEN BAGPIPES WERE PLAYING AND LADS AND LASSES WERE DANCING TO THE MUSIC BUT THE CROWD WERE GATHERED MOST OF ALL AROUND A RING WHERE THE WRESTLING WAS GOING FORWARD AND THITHER SIR RICHARD AND HIS MEN TURNED THEIR STEPS NOW WHEN THE JUDGES OF THE WRESTLING SAW SIR RICHARD COMING AND KNEW WHO HE WAS THE CHIEF OF THEM CAME DOWN FROM THE BENCH WHERE HE AND THE OTHERS SAT AND WENT TO THE KNIGHT AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND BESEECHING HIM TO COME AND SIT WITH THEM AND JUDGE THE SPORT SO SIR RICHARD GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND WENT WITH THE OTHERS TO THE BENCH RAISED BESIDE THE RING NOW THERE HAD BEEN GREAT DOINGS THAT MORNING FOR A CERTAIN YEOMAN NAMED EGBERT WHO CAME FROM STOKE OVER IN STAFFORDSHIRE HAD THROWN WITH EASE ALL THOSE THAT CAME AGAINST HIM BUT A MAN OF DENBY WELL KNOWN THROUGH ALL THE COUNTRYSIDE AS WILLIAM OF THE SCAR HAD BEEN BIDING HIS TIME WITH THE STOKE MAN SO WHEN EGBERT HAD THROWN EVERYONE ELSE STOUT WILLIAM LEAPED INTO THE RING THEN A TOUGH BOUT FOLLOWED AND AT LAST HE THREW EGBERT HEAVILY WHEREAT THERE WAS A GREAT SHOUTING AND SHAKING OF HANDS FOR ALL THE DENBY MEN WERE PROUD OF THEIR WRESTLER WHEN SIR RICHARD CAME HE FOUND STOUT WILLIAM PUFFED UP BY THE SHOUTS OF HIS FRIENDS WALKING UP AND DOWN THERING DARING ANYONE TO COME AND TRY A THROW WITH HIM COME ONE COME ALL QUOTH HE HERE STAND I WILLIAM OF THE SCAR AGAINST ANY MAN IF THERE IS NONE IN DERBYSHIRE TO COME AGAINST ME COME ALL WHO WILL FROM NOTTINGHAM STAFFORD OR YORK AND IF I DO NOT MAKE THEM ONE AND ALL ROOT THE GROUND WITH THEIR NOSES LIKE SWINE IN THE FORESTS CALL ME NO MORE BRAVE WILLIAM THE WRESTLER AT THIS ALL LAUGHED BUT ABOVE ALL THE LAUGHTER A LOUD VOICE WAS HEARD TO CRY OUT SIN THOU TALKEST SO BIG HERE COMETH ONE FROM NOTTINGHAMSHIRE TO TRY A FALL WITH THEE FELLOW AND STRAIGHTWAY A TALL YOUTH WITH A TOUGH QUARTERSTAFF IN HIS HAND CAME PUSHING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD AND AT LAST LEAPED LIGHTLY OVER THE ROPE INTO THE RING HE WAS NOT AS HEAVY AS STOUT WILLIAM BUT HE WAS TALLER AND BROADER IN THE SHOULDERS AND ALL HIS JOINTS WERE WELL KNIT SIR RICHARD LOOKED UPON HIM KEENLY THEN TURNING TO ONE OF THE JUDGES HE SAID KNOWEST THOU WHO THIS YOUTH IS METHINKS I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE NAY SAID THE JUDGE HE IS A STRANGER TO ME MEANTIME WITHOUT A WORD THE YOUNG MAN LAYING ASIDE HIS QUARTERSTAFF BEGAN TO TAKE OFF HIS JERKIN AND BODY CLOTHING UNTIL HE PRESENTLY STOOD WITH NAKED ARMS AND BODY AND A COMELY SIGHT HE WAS WHEN SO BARED TO THE VIEW FOR HIS MUSCLES WERE CUT ROUND AND SMOOTH AND SHARP LIKE SWIFTRUNNING WATER AND NOW EACH MAN SPAT UPON HIS HANDS AND CLAPPING THEM UPON HIS KNEES SQUATTED DOWN WATCHING THE OTHER KEENLY SO AS TO TAKE THE VANTAGE OF HIM IN THE GRIP THEN LIKE A FLASH THEY LEAPED TOGETHER AND A GREAT SHOUT WENTUP FOR WILLIAM HAD GOTTEN THE BETTER HOLD OF THE TWO FOR A SHORT TIME THEY STRAINED AND STRUGGLED AND WRITHED AND THEN STOUT WILLIAM GAVE HIS MOST CUNNING TRIP AND THROW BUT THE STRANGER MET IT WITH GREATER SKILL THAN HIS AND SO THE TRIP CAME TO NOUGHT THEN OF A SUDDEN WITH A TWIST AND A WRENCH THE STRANGER LOOSED HIMSELF AND HE OF THE SCAR FOUND HIMSELF LOCKED IN A PAIR OF ARMS THAT FAIRLY MADE HIS RIBS CRACK SO WITH HEAVY HOT BREATHING THEY STOOD FOR A WHILE STRAINING THEIR BODIES ALL GLISTENING WITH SWEAT AND GREAT DROPS OF SWEAT TRICKLING DOWN THEIR FACES BUT THE STRANGERS HUG WAS SO CLOSE THAT AT LAST STOUT WILLIAMS MUSCLES SOFTENED UNDER HIS GRIP AND HE GAVE A SOB THEN THE YOUTH PUT FORTH ALL HIS STRENGTH AND GAVE A SUDDEN TRIP WITH HIS HEEL AND A CAST OVER HIS RIGHT HIP AND DOWN STOUT WILLIAM WENT WITH A SICKENING THUD AND LAY AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER MOVE HAND NOR FOOT AGAIN BUT NOW NO SHOUT WENT UP FOR THE STRANGER BUT AN ANGRY MURMUR WAS HEARD AMONG THE CROWD SO EASILY HAD HE WON THE MATCH THEN ONE OF THE JUDGES A KINSMAN TO WILLIAM OF THE SCAR ROSE WITH TREMBLING LIP AND BALEFUL LOOK QUOTH HE IF THOU HATH SLAIN THAT MAN IT WILL GO ILL WITH THEE LET ME TELL THEE FELLOW BUT THE STRANGER ANSWERED BOLDLY HE TOOK HIS CHANCE WITH ME AS I TOOK MINE WITH HIM NO LAW CAN TOUCH ME TO HARM ME EVEN IF I SLEW HIM SO THAT IT WAS FAIRLY DONE IN THE WRESTLING RING THAT WE SHALL SEE SAID THE JUDGE SCOWLING UPON THE YOUTH WHILE ONCE MORE AN ANGRY MURMUR RAN AROUND THE CROWD FOR AS I HAVE SAID THE MEN OF DENBY WERE PROUD OF STOUT WILLIAM OF THE SCARTHEN UP SPOKE SIR RICHARD GENTLY NAY SAID HE THE YOUTH IS RIGHT IF THE OTHER DIETH HE DIETH IN THE WRESTLING RING WHERE HE TOOK HIS CHANCE AND WAS CAST FAIRLY ENOW BUT IN THE MEANTIME THREE MEN HAD COME FORWARD AND LIFTED STOUT WILLIAM FROM THE GROUND AND FOUND THAT HE WAS NOT DEAD THOUGH BADLY SHAKEN BY HIS HEAVY FALL THEN THE CHIEF JUDGE ROSE AND SAID YOUNG MAN THE PRIZE IS DULY THINE HERE IS THE RED GOLD RING AND HERE THE GLOVES

RING AND THRUSTING THE ONE INTO HIS GIRDLE AND SLIPPING THE OTHER UPON HIS THUMB HE TURNED AND LEAPING LIGHTLY OVER THE ROPES AGAIN MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD AND WAS GONE NOW I WONDER WHO YON YOUTH MAY BE SAID THE JUDGE TURNING TO SIR RICHARD HE SEEMETH LIKE A STOUT SAXON FROM HIS RED CHEEKS AND FAIR HAIR THIS WILLIAM OF OURS IS A STOUT MAN TOO AND NEVER HAVE I SEEN HIM CAST IN THE RING

AND YET THIS YOUTH THREW HIM FAIRLY AND WITH WONDROUS EASE I MUCH WONDER WHO HE CAN BE THUS SAID SIR RICHARD IN A THOUGHTFUL VOICE FOR A TIME THE KNIGHT STOOD TALKING TO THOSE ABOUT HIM BUT AT LAST HE AROSE AND MADE READY TO DEPART SO HE CALLEDHIS MEN ABOUT HIM AND TIGHTENING THE GIRTHS OF HIS SADDLE HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE ONCE MORE MEANWHILE THE YOUNG STRANGER HAD MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD BUT AS HE PASSED HE HEARD ALL AROUND HIM SUCH WORDS MUTTERED AS LOOK AT THE COCKEREL BEHOLD HOW HE PLUMETH HIMSELF I DARE SWEAR HE CAST GOOD WILLIAM UNFAIRLY YEA TRULY SAW YE NOT BIRDLIME UPON HIS HANDS IT WOULD BE WELL TO CUT HIS COCKS COMB TO ALL THIS THE STRANGER PAID NO HEED BUT STRODE PROUDLY ABOUT AS THOUGH HE HEARD IT NOT SO HE WALKED SLOWLY ACROSS THE GREEN TO WHERE THE BOOTH STOOD WHEREIN WAS DANCING AND STANDING AT THE DOOR HE LOOKED IN ON THE SPORT AS HE STOOD THUS A STONE STRUCK HIS ARM OF A SUDDEN WITH A SHARP JAR AND TURNING HE SAW THAT AN ANGRY CROWD OF MEN HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM THE WRESTLING RING THEN WHEN THEY SAW HIM TURN SO A GREAT HOOTING AND YELLING AROSE FROM ALL SO THAT THE FOLK CAME RUNNING OUT FROM THE DANCING BOOTH TO SEE WHAT WAS TO DO AT LAST A TALL BROAD SHOULDERED BURLY BLACKSMITH STRODE FORWARD FROM THE CROWD SWINGING A MIGHTY BLACKTHORN CLUB IN HIS HAND WOULDST THOU COME HERE TO OUR FAIR TOWN OF DENBY THOU JACK IN THE BOX TO OVERCOME A GOOD HONEST LAD WITH VILE JUGGLING TRICKS GROWLED HE IN A DEEP VOICE LIKE THE BELLOW OF AN ANGRY BULL TAKE THAT THEN AND OF A SUDDEN HE STRUCK A BLOW AT THE YOUTH THAT MIGHT HAVE FELLED AN OX BUT THE OTHER TURNED THE BLOW DEFTLY ASIDE AND GAVE BACK ANOTHER SO TERRIBLE THAT THE DENBY MAN WENT DOWN WITH A GROAN AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SMITTEN BY LIGHTNING WHEN THEY SAW THEIR LEADER FALL THE CROWD GAVE ANOTHER ANGRY SHOUT BUTTHE STRANGER PLACED HIS BACK AGAINST THE TENT NEAR WHICH HE STOOD SWINGING HIS TERRIBLE STAFF AND SO FELL HAD BEEN THE BLOW THAT HE STRUCK THE STOUT SMITH THAT NONE DARED TO COME WITHIN THE MEASURE OF HIS CUDGEL SO THE PRESS CROWDED BACK LIKE A PACK OF DOGS FROM A BEAR AT BAY BUT NOW SOME COWARD HAND FROM BEHIND THREW A SHARP JAGGED STONE THAT SMOTE THE STRANGER ON THE CROWN SO THAT HE STAGGERED BACK AND THE RED BLOOD GUSHED FROM THE CUT AND RAN DOWN HIS FACE AND OVER HIS JERKIN THEN SEEING HIM DAZED WITH THIS VILE BLOW THE CROWD RUSHED UPON HIM SO THAT THEY OVERBORE HIM AND HE FELL BENEATH THEIR FEET NOW IT MIGHT HAVE GONE ILL WITH THE YOUTH EVEN TO THE LOSING OF HIS YOUNG LIFE HAD NOT SIR RICHARD COME TO THIS FAIR FOR OF A SUDDEN SHOUTS WERE HEARD AND STEEL FLASHED IN THE AIR AND BLOWS WERE GIVEN WITH THE FLAT OF SWORDS WHILE THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE CROWD SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA CAME SPURRING ON HIS WHITE HORSE THEN THE CROWD SEEING THE STEEL CLAD KNIGHT AND THE ARMED MEN MELTED AWAY LIKE SNOW ON THE WARM HEARTH LEAVING THE YOUNG MAN ALL BLOODY AND DUSTY UPON THE GROUND FINDING HIMSELF FREE THE YOUTH AROSE AND WIPING THE BLOOD FROM HIS FACE LOOKED UP QUOTH HE SIR

PROUD THAT ONE OF THE GREAT WRESTLERS OF ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE ENTERED THE RING AT DENBY FAIR FOR THUS FICKLE IS A MASS OF MEN THEN SIR RICHARD CALLED ALOUD FRIENDS THIS IS DAVID OF DONCASTER SO THINK

FORKING OF THE ROADS HE WALKED MERRILY ONWARD IN THE MELLOW SUNSHINE THAT SHONE ABOUT HIM EVER AND ANON HE WOULD SKIP AND LEAP OR SING A SNATCH OF SONG FOR PURE JOYOUSNESS OF THE DAY FOR BECAUSE OF THE SWEETNESS OF THE SPRINGTIDE HIS HEART WAS AS LUSTY WITHIN HIM AS THAT OF A COLT NEWLY TURNED OUT TO GRASS SOMETIMES HE WOULD WALK A LONG DISTANCE GAZING ALOFT AT THE GREAT WHITE SWELLING CLOUDS THAT MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE DEEP BLUE SKY ANON HE WOULD STOP AND DRINK IN THE FULLNESS OF LIFE OF ALL THINGS FOR THE HEDGEROWS WERE BUDDING TENDERLY AND THE GRASS OF THE MEADOWS WAS WAXING LONG AND GREEN AGAIN HE WOULD STAND STILL AND LISTEN TO THE PRETTY SONG OF THE LITTLE BIRDS IN THE THICKETS OR HEARKEN TO THE CLEAR CROW OF THE COCK DARING THE SKY TO RAIN WHEREAT HE WOULD LAUGH FOR IT TOOK BUT LITTLE TO TICKLE ROBINS HEART INTO MERRIMENT SO HE TRUDGED MANFULLY ALONG EVER WILLING TO STOP FOR THIS REASON OR FOR THAT AND EVER READY TO CHAT WITH SUCH MERRY LASSES AS HE MET NOW AND THEN SO THE MORNING SLIPPED ALONG BUT YET HE MET NO BEGGAR WITH WHOM HE COULD CHANGE CLOTHES QUOTH HE IF I DO NOT CHANGE MY LUCK IN HASTE I AM LIKE TO HAVE AN EMPTY DAY OF IT FOR IT IS WELL NIGH HALF GONE ALREADY AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE HAD A MERRY WALK THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE I KNOW NOUGHT OF A BEGGARS LIFETHEN AFTER A WHILE HE BEGAN TO GROW HUNGRY WHEREUPON HIS MIND TURNED FROM THOUGHTS OF SPRINGTIME AND FLOWERS AND BIRDS AND DWELLED UPON BOILED CAPONS MALMSEY WHITE BREAD AND THE LIKE WITH GREAT TENDERNESS QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF I WOULD I HAD WILLIE WYNKINS WISHING COAT I KNOW RIGHT WELL WHAT I SHOULD WISH FOR AND THIS IT SHOULD BE HERE HE MARKED UPON THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND WITH THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND THOSE THINGS WHICH HE WISHED FOR FIRSTLY I WOULD HAVE A SWEET BROWN PIE OF TENDER LARKS MARK YE NOT DRY COOKED BUT WITH A GOOD SOP OF GRAVY TO MOISTEN IT WITHAL NEXT I WOULD HAVE A PRETTY PULLET FAIRLY BOILED WITH TENDER PIGEONS EGGS CUNNINGLY SLICED GARNISHING THE PLATTER AROUND WITH THESE I WOULD HAVE A LONG SLIM LOAF OF WHEATEN BREAD THAT HATH BEEN BAKED UPON THE HEARTH IT SHOULD BE WARM FROM THE FIRE WITH GLOSSY BROWN CRUST THE COLOR OF THE HAIR OF MINE OWN MAID MARIAN AND THIS SAME CRUST SHOULD BE AS CRISP AND BRITTLE AS THE THIN WHITE ICE THAT LIES ACROSS THE FURROWS IN THE EARLY WINTERS MORNING THESE WILL DO FOR THE MORE SOLID THINGS BUT WITH THESE I MUST HAVE THREE POTTIES FAT AND ROUND ONE FULL OF MALMSEY ONE OF CANARY AND ONE BRIMMING FULL OF MINE OWN DEAR LUSTY SACK THUS SPOKE ROBIN TO HIMSELF HIS MOUTH GROWING MOIST AT THE CORNERS WITH THE THOUGHTS OF THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD RAISED IN HIS OWN MIND SO TALKING TO HIMSELF HE CAME TO WHERE THE DUSTY ROAD TURNED SHARPLY AROUND THE HEDGE ALL TENDER WITH THE GREEN OF THE COMING LEAF AND THERE HE SAW BEFORE HIM A STOUT FELLOW SITTING UPON A STILE SWINGING HIS LEGS IN IDLENESS ALL ABOUT THIS LUSTY ROGUE DANGLED DIVERS POUCHES AND BAGS OFDIFFERENT SIZES AND KINDS A DOZEN OR MORE WITH GREAT WIDE GAPING MOUTHS LIKE A BROOD OF HUNGRY DAWS HIS COAT WAS GATHERED IN AT HIS WAIST AND WAS PATCHED WITH AS MANY COLORS AS THERE ARE STRIPES UPON A MAYPOLE IN THE SPRINGTIDE ON HIS HEAD HE WORE A GREAT TALL LEATHERN CAP AND ACROSS HIS KNEES RESTED A STOUT QUARTERSTAFF OF BLACKTHORN FULL AS LONG AND HEAVY AS ROBINS AS JOLLY A BEGGAR WAS HE AS EVER TROD THE LANES AND BYWAYS OF NOTTINGHAMSHIRE FOR HIS EYES WERE AS GRAY AS SLATE AND SNAPPED AND TWINKLED AND DANCED WITH MERRIMENT AND HIS BLACK HAIR CURLED CLOSE ALL OVER HIS HEAD IN LITTLE RINGS OF KINKINESS HALLOA GOOD FELLOW QUOTH ROBIN WHEN HE HAD COME NIGH TO THE OTHER WHAT ART THOU DOING HERE THIS MERRY DAY WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE PEEPING AND THE BUDS ARE SWELLING THEN THE OTHER WINKED ONE EYE AND STRAIGHTWAY TROLLED FORTH IN A MERRY VOICE I SIT UPON THE STILE AND I SING A LITTLE WHILE AS I WAIT FOR MY OWN TRUE DEAR O FOR THE SUN IS SHINING BRIGHT AND THE LEAVES ARE DANCING LIGHT AND THE LITTLE FOWL SINGS SHE IS NEAR O AND SO IT IS WITH ME BULLY BOY SAVING THAT MY DOXY COMETH NOT NOW THAT IS A RIGHT SWEET SONG QUOTH ROBIN AND WERE I IN THE RIGHT MIND TO LISTEN TO THEE I COULD BEAR WELL TO HEAR MORE BUT I HAVE TWO THINGS OF SERIOUSNESS TO ASK OF THEE SOLISTEN I PRYTHEE AT THIS THE JOLLY BEGGAR COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE LIKE A ROGUE OF A MAGPIE QUOTH HE I AM AN ILL JUG TO POUR HEAVY THINGS INTO GOOD FRIEND AND IF I MISTAKE NOT THOU HAST FEW SERIOUS WORDS TO SPARE AT ANY TIME NAY QUOTH JOLLY ROBIN WHAT I WOULD SAY FIRST IS THE MOST SERIOUS OF ALL THOUGHTS TO ME TO WIT WHERE SHALL I GET SOMEWHAT TO EAT AND DRINK SAYST THOU SO QUOTH THE BEGGAR MARRY I MAKE NO SUCH SERIOUS THOUGHTS UPON THE MATTER I EAT WHEN I CAN GET IT AND MUNCH MY CRUST WHEN I CAN GET NO CRUMB LIKEWISE WHEN THERE IS NO ALE TO BE HAD I WASH THE DUST FROM OUT MY

GAINED BY LONG LABOR IN THAT LINE AFTER A WHILE BACK CAME ROBIN BEARING A GOODLY SKIN OF ALE UPON HIS SHOULDER WHICH HE LAID UPON THE GRASS THEN LOOKING UPON THE FEAST SPREAD UPON THE GROUND AND A FAIR SIGHT IT WAS TO LOOK UPON HE SLOWLY RUBBED HIS HAND OVER HIS STOMACH FOR TO HIS HUNGRY EYES IT SEEMED THE FAIREST SIGHT THAT HE HAD BEHELD IN ALL HIS LIFE FRIEND SAID THE BEGGAR LET ME FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THAT SKIN YEA TRULY QUOTH ROBIN HELP THYSELF SWEET CHUCK AND MEANTIME LET ME SEE WHETHER THY PIGEON PIE IS FRESH OR NO SO THE ONE SEIZED UPON THE ALE AND THE OTHER UPON THE PIGEON PIE AND

WEST WINDS BOOTS UPON THEIR FEET ROBIN LOOKED AFTER THEM LAUGHING AND THOUGHT THAT NEVER HAD HE SEEN SO FLEET A RUNNER AS THE LAME MAN BUT NEITHER OF THE BEGGARS STOPPED NOR TURNED AROUND FOR EACH FELT IN HIS MIND THE WIND OF ROBINS CUDGEL ABOUT HIS EARS THEN ROBIN TURNED TO THE TWO STOUT KNAVES LYING UPON THE GROUND QUOTH HE THESE FELLOWS SPAKE SOMEWHAT ABOUT CERTAIN MONEYS THEY WERE TAKING TO LINCOLN METHINKS I MAY FIND IT UPON THIS STOUT BLIND FELLOW WHO HATH AS KEEN SIGHT AS EER A TRAINED WOODSMAN IN NOTTINGHAM OR YORKSHIRE IT WERE A PITY TO LET SOUND MONEY STAY IN THE POCKETS OF SUCH THIEVING KNAVES SO SAYING HE STOOPED OVER THE BURLY RASCAL AND SEARCHED AMONG HIS RAGS AND TATTERS TILL PRESENTLY HIS FINGERS FELT A LEATHERN POUCH SLUNG AROUND HIS BODY BENEATH HIS PATCHED AND TATTERED COAT THIS HE STRIPPED AWAY AND WEIGHING IT IN HIS HANDS BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT IT WAS MIGHTY HEAVY IT WERE A SWEET THING SAID HE TO HIMSELF IF THIS WERE FILLED WITH GOLD INSTEAD OF COPPER PENCE THEN SITTING DOWN UPON THE GRASS HE OPENED THE POCKET AND LOOKED INTO IT THERE HE FOUND FOUR ROUND ROLLS WRAPPED UP IN DRESSED SHEEPSKIN ONE OF THESE ROLLS HE OPENED THEN HIS MOUTH GAPED AND HIS EYES STARED I WOT AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER CLOSE AGAIN FOR WHAT DID HE SEE BUT FIFTY POUNDS OF BRIGHT GOLDEN MONEY HE OPENED THE OTHER POCKETS AND FOUND IN EACH ONE THE SAME FIFTY BRIGHT NEW STAMPED GOLDEN POUNDS QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE OFT HEARD THAT THE BEGGARSGUILD WAS OVER RICH BUT NEVER DID I THINK THAT THEY SENT SUCH SUMS AS THIS TO THEIR TREASURY I SHALL TAKE IT WITH ME FOR IT WILL BE BETTER USED FOR CHARITY AND THE GOOD OF MY MERRY BAND THAN IN THE ENRICHING OF SUCH KNAVES AS THESE SO SAYING HE ROLLED UP THE MONEY IN THE SHEEPSKIN AGAIN AND PUTTING IT BACK IN THE PURSE HE THRUST THE POUCH INTO HIS OWN BOSOM THEN TAKING UP THE FLASK OF MALMSEY HE HELD IT TOWARD THE TWO FELLOWS LYING ON THE GRASS AND QUOTH HE SWEET FRIENDS I DRINK YOUR HEALTH AND THANK YOU DEARLY FOR WHAT YE HAVE SO KINDLY GIVEN ME THIS DAY AND SO I WISH YOU GOOD DEN THEN TAKING UP HIS STAFF HE LEFT THE SPOT AND WENT MERRILY ON HIS WAY BUT WHEN THE TWO STOUT BEGGARS THAT HAD BEEN RAPPED UPON THE HEAD ROUSED THEMSELVES AND SAT UP AND WHEN THE OTHERS HAD GOTTEN OVER THEIR FRIGHT AND COME BACK THEY WERE AS SAD AND WOEBEGONE AS FOUR FROGS IN DRY WEATHER FOR TWO OF THEM HAD CRACKED CROWNS THEIR MALMSEY WAS ALL GONE AND THEY HAD NOT SO MUCH AS A FARTHING TO CROSS THEIR PALMS WITHAL BUT AFTER ROBIN LEFT THE LITTLE DELL HE STRODE ALONG MERRILY SINGING AS HE WENT AND SO BLITHE WAS HE AND SUCH A STOUT BEGGAR AND WITHAL SO FRESH AND CLEAN THAT EVERY MERRY LASS HE MET HAD A SWEET WORD FOR HIM AND FELT NO FEAR WHILE THE VERY DOGS THAT MOST TIMES HATE THE SIGHT OF A BEGGAR SNUFFED AT HIS LEGS IN FRIENDLY WISE AND WAGGED THEIR TAILS PLEASANTLY FOR DOGS KNOW AN HONEST MAN BY HIS SMELL AND AN HONEST MAN ROBIN WAS IN HIS OWN WAY THUS HE WENT ALONG TILL AT LAST HE HAD COME TO THE WAYSIDE CROSS NIGH OLLERTON AND

ONE MORE MERRY ADVENTURE ERE I GO BACK AGAIN TO MY JOLLY BAND SO HE LOOKED UP THE ROAD AND DOWN THE ROAD TO SEE WHO MIGHT COME UNTIL AT LAST HE SAW SOMEONE DRAWING NEAR RIDING UPON A HORSE WHEN THE TRAVELER CAME NIGH ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SEE HIM WELL ROBIN LAUGHED FOR A STRANGE ENOUGH FIGURE HE CUT HE WAS A THIN WIZENED MAN AND TO LOOK UPON HIM YOU COULD NOT TELL WHETHER HE WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD OR

THEY HAD BEST BE JOGGING AS IT WAS LIKE TO BE ILL FOR THEM SO NIGH MERRY LONDON TOWN SO WITHOUT TARRYING LONGER THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWD UNTIL THEY HAD COME OUT FROM THE PRESS THEN WITHOUT STOPPING THEY LEFT LONDON TOWN AND STARTED AWAY NORTHWARDTHE CHASE OF ROBIN HOOD SO ROBIN HOOD AND THE OTHERS LEFT THE ARCHERY RANGE AT FINSBURY FIELDS AND TARRYING NOT SET FORTH STRAIGHTWAY UPON THEIR HOMEWARD JOURNEY IT WAS WELL FOR THEM THAT THEY DID SO FOR THEY HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR MILES UPON THEIR WAY WHEN SIX OF THE YEOMEN OF THE KINGS GUARD CAME BUSTLING AMONG THE CROWD THAT STILL LINGERED SEEKING FOR ROBIN AND HIS MEN TO SEIZE UPON THEM AND MAKE THEM PRISONERS TRULY IT WAS AN ILL DONE THING IN THE KING TO BREAK HIS PROMISE BUT IT ALL CAME ABOUT THROUGH THE BISHOP OF HEREFORDS DOING FOR THUS IT HAPPENED AFTER THE KING LEFT THE ARCHERY GROUND HE WENT STRAIGHTWAY TO HIS CABINET AND WITH HIM WENT THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD AND SIR ROBERT LEE BUT THE KING SAID NEVER A WORD TO THESE TWO BUT SAT GNAWING HIS NETHER LIP FOR HIS HEART WAS GALLED WITHIN HIM BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT LAST THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD SPOKE IN A LOW SORROWFUL VOICE IT IS A SAD THING YOUR MAJESTY THAT THIS KNAVISH OUTLAW SHOULD BE LET TO ESCAPE IN THIS WISE FOR LET HIM BUT GET BACK TO SHERWOOD FOREST SAFE AND SOUND AND HE MAY SNAP HIS FINGERS AT KING AND KINGS MEN AT THESE WORDS THE KING RAISED HIS EYES AND LOOKED GRIMLY UPON THE BISHOP SAYST THOU SO QUOTH HE NOW I WILL SHOW THEE IN GOOD TIME HOW MUCH THOU DOST ERR FOR WHEN THE FORTY DAYS ARE PAST AND GONE I WILL SEIZE UPON THIS THIEVING OUTLAW IF I HAVE TO TEAR DOWN ALL OF SHERWOOD TO FIND HIM THINKEST THOU THAT THE LAWS OF THE KING OF ENGLAND ARE TO BE SO EVADED BY ONE POOR KNAVE WITHOUT FRIENDS OR MONEY THEN THE BISHOP SPOKE AGAIN IN HIS SOFT SMOOTH VOICE FORGIVE MY BOLDNESS YOUR MAJESTY AND BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOUGHT BUT THE GOOD OF ENGLAND AND YOUR MAJESTYS DESIRINGS AT HEART BUT WHAT WOULD IT BOOT THOUGH MY GRACIOUS LORD DID ROOT UP EVERY TREE OF SHERWOOD ARE THERE NOT OTHER PLACES FOR ROBIN HOODS HIDING CANNOCK CHASE IS NOT FAR FROM SHERWOOD AND THE GREAT FOREST OF ARDEN IS NOT FAR FROM CANNOCK CHASE BESIDE THESE ARE MANY OTHER WOODLANDS IN NOTTINGHAM AND DERBY LINCOLN AND YORK AMID ANY OF WHICH YOUR MAJESTY MIGHT AS WELL THINK TO SEIZE UPON ROBIN HOOD AS TO LAY FINGER UPON A RAT AMONG THE DUST AND BROKEN THINGS OF A GARRET NAY MY GRACIOUS LORD IF HE DOTH ONCE PLANT FOOT IN THE WOODLAND HE IS LOST TO THE LAW FOREVER AT THESE WORDS THE KING TAPPED HIS FINGERTIPS UPON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM WITH VEXATION WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE ME DO BISHOP QUOTH HE DIDST THOU NOT HEAR ME PLEDGE MY WORD TO THE QUEEN THY TALK IS AS BARREN AS THE WIND FROM THE BELLOWS UPON DEAD COALS FAR BE IT FROM ME SAID THE CUNNING BISHOP TO POINT THE WAY TO ONE SO CLEAR SIGHTED AS YOUR MAJESTY BUT WERE I THE KING OF ENGLAND I SHOULD LOOK UPON THE MATTER IN THIS WISE I HAVE PROMISED MY QUEEN LET US SAY THAT FOR FORTY DAYS THE CUNNINGEST ROGUE IN ALL ENGLAND SHALL HAVE FREEDOM TO COME AND GO BUT LO I FIND THIS OUTLAW IN MY GRASP SHALL ITHEN FOOLISHLY CLING TO A PROMISE SO HASTILY GIVEN SUPPOSE THAT I HAD PROMISED TO DO HER MAJESTYS BIDDING WHEREUPON SHE BADE ME TO SLAY MYSELF SHOULD I THEN SHUT MINE EYES AND RUN BLINDLY UPON MY SWORD THUS WOULD I ARGUE WITHIN MYSELF MOREOVER I WOULD SAY UNTO MYSELF A WOMAN KNOWETH NOUGHT OF THE GREAT THINGS APPERTAINING TO STATE GOVERNMENT AND LIKEWISE I KNOW A WOMAN IS EVER PRONE TO TAKE UP A FANCY EVEN AS SHE WOULD PLUCK A DAISY FROM THE ROADSIDE AND THEN THROW IT AWAY WHEN THE SAVOR IS GONE THEREFORE THOUGH SHE HATH TAKEN A FANCY TO THIS OUTLAW IT WILL SOON WANE AWAY AND BE FORGOTTEN AS FOR ME I HAVE THE GREATEST VILLAIN IN ALL ENGLAND IN MY GRASP SHALL I THEN OPEN MY HAND AND LET HIM SLIP BETWIXT MY FINGERS THUS YOUR MAJESTY WOULD I SAY TO MYSELF WERE I THE KING OF ENGLAND SO THE BISHOP TALKED AND THE KING LENT HIS EAR TO HIS EVIL COUNSEL UNTIL AFTER A WHILE HE TURNED TO SIR ROBERT LEE AND BADE HIM SEND SIX OF THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD TO TAKE ROBIN HOOD AND HIS THREE MEN PRISONERS NOW SIR ROBERT LEE WAS A GENTLE AND NOBLE KNIGHT AND HE FELT GRIEVED TO THE HEART TO SEE THE KING SO BREAK HIS PROMISE NEVERTHELESS HE SAID NOTHING FOR HE SAW HOW BITTERLY THE KING WAS SET AGAINST ROBIN HOOD BUT HE DID NOT SEND THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD AT ONCE BUT WENT FIRST TO THE QUEEN AND TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AND BADE HER SEND WORD TO ROBIN OF HIS DANGER THIS HE DID NOT FOR THE WELL BEING OF ROBIN HOOD BUT BECAUSE HE WOULD SAVE HIS LORDS HONOR IF HE COULD THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT WHEN AFTER A WHILE THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD WENT TO THE ARCHERY FIELD THEY FOUND NOT ROBIN AND THE OTHERS AND SO GOT NO CAKES AT THAT FAIRTHE AFTERNOON WAS ALREADY WELL NIGH GONE WHEN ROBIN HOOD LITTLE JOHN WILL AND ALLAN SET FORTH UPON THEIR HOMEWARD WAY TRUDGING ALONG MERRILY THROUGH THE YELLOW SLANTING LIGHT WHICH SPEEDILY CHANGED TO ROSY RED AS THE SUN SANK LOW IN THE HEAVENS THE SHADOWS GREW LONG AND FINALLY MERGED INTO THE GRAYNESS OF THE MELLOW TWILIGHT THE DUSTY HIGHWAY LAY ALL WHITE BETWIXT THE DARK HEDGEROWS AND ALONG IT WALKED FOUR FELLOWS LIKE FOUR SHADOWS THE PAT OF THEIR FEET SOUNDING LOUD AND THEIR VOICES AS THEY TALKED RINGING CLEAR UPON THE SILENCE OF THE AIR THE GREAT ROUND MOON WAS FLOATING BREATHLESSLY UP IN THE EASTERN SKY WHEN THEY SAW BEFORE THEM THE TWINKLING LIGHTS OF BARNET TOWN SOME TEN OR TWELVE MILES FROM LONDON DOWN THEY WALKED THROUGH THE STONY STREETS AND PAST THE COSY HOUSES WITH OVERHANGING GABLES BEFORE THE DOORS OF WHICH SAT THE BURGHERS AND CRAFTSMEN IN THE MELLOW MOONLIGHT WITH THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT THEM AND SO CAME AT LAST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HAMLET TO A LITTLE INN ALL SHADED WITH ROSES AND WOODBINES BEFORE THIS INN ROBIN HOOD STOPPED FOR THE SPOT PLEASED HIM WELL QUOTH HE HERE WILL WE TAKE UP OUR INN AND REST FOR THE NIGHT FOR WE ARE WELL AWAY FROM LONDON TOWN AND OUR KINGS WRATH MOREOVER IF I MISTAKE NOT WE WILL FIND SWEET FARING WITHIN WHAT SAY YE LADS IN SOOTH GOOD MASTER QUOTH LITTLE JOHN THY BIDDING AND MY DOING EVER FIT TOGETHER LIKE CAKES AND ALE LET US IN I SAY ALSO THEN UP SPAKE WILL SCARLET I AM EVER READY TO DO WHAT THOU SAYEST UNCLE YET I COULD WISH THAT WE WERE FARTHER UPON OUR WAY ERE WE REST FOR THE NIGHT NEVERTHELESS IF THOUTHINKEST BEST LET US IN FOR THE NIGHT SAY I ALSO SO IN THEY WENT AND CALLED FOR THE BEST THAT THE PLACE AFFORDED THEN A RIGHT GOOD FEAST WAS SET BEFORE THEM WITH TWO STOUT BOTTLES OF OLD SACK TO WASH IT DOWN WITHAL THESE THINGS WERE SERVED BY AS PLUMP AND BUXOM A LASS AS YOU COULD FIND IN ALL THE LAND SO THAT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALWAYS HAD AN EYE FOR A FAIR LASS EVEN WHEN MEAT AND DRINK WERE BY STUCK HIS ARMS AKIMBO AND FIXED HIS EYES UPON HER WINKING SWEETLY WHENEVER HE SAW HER LOOKING TOWARD HIM THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW THE LASS TWITTERED WITH LAUGHTER AND HOW SHE LOOKED AT LITTLE JOHN OUT OF THE CORNERS OF HER EYES A DIMPLE COMING IN EITHER CHEEK FOR THE FELLOW HAD ALWAYS A TAKING WAY WITH THE WOMENFOLK SO THE FEAST PASSED MERRILY AND NEVER HAD THAT INN SEEN SUCH LUSTY FEEDERS AS THESE FOUR STOUT FELLOWS BUT AT LAST THEY WERE DONE THEIR EATING THOUGH IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE ENDED AND SAT LOITERING OVER THE SACK AS THEY SO SAT THE LANDLORD CAME IN OF A SUDDEN AND SAID THAT THERE WAS ONE AT THE DOOR A CERTAIN YOUNG ESQUIRE RICHARD PARTINGTON OF THE QUEENS HOUSEHOLD WHO WISHED TO SEE THE LAD IN BLUE AND SPEAK WITH HIM WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME SO ROBIN AROSE QUICKLY AND BIDDING THE LANDLORD NOT TO FOLLOW HIM LEFT THE OTHERS GAZING AT ONE ANOTHER AND WONDERING WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN WHEN ROBIN CAME OUT OF THE INN HE FOUND YOUNG RICHARD PARTINGTON SITTING UPON HIS HORSE IN THE WHITE MOONLIGHT AWAITING HIS COMING WHAT NEWS BEAREST THOU SIR PAGE SAID ROBIN I TRUST THAT IT IS NOT OF AN ILL NATUREWHY SAID YOUNG PARTINGTON FOR THE MATTER OF THAT IT IS ILL ENOW THE KING HATH BEEN BITTERLY STIRRED UP AGAINST THEE BY THAT VILE BISHOP OF HEREFORD HE SENT TO ARREST THEE AT THE ARCHERY BUTTS AT FINSBURY FIELDS BUT NOT FINDING THEE THERE HE HATH GATHERED TOGETHER HIS ARMED MEN FIFTYSCORE AND MORE AND IS SENDING THEM IN HASTE ALONG THIS VERY ROAD TO SHERWOOD EITHER TO TAKE THEE ON THE WAY OR TO PREVENT THY GETTING BACK TO THE WOODLANDS AGAIN HE HATH GIVEN THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD COMMAND OVER ALL THESE MEN AND THOU KNOWEST WHAT THOU HAST TO EXPECT OF THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD SHORT SHRIFT AND A LONG ROPE TWO BANDS OF HORSEMEN ARE ALREADY UPON THE ROAD NOT FAR BEHIND ME SO THOU HADST BEST GET THEE GONE FROM THIS PLACE STRAIGHTWAY FOR IF THOU TARRIEST LONGER THOU ART LIKE TO SLEEP THIS NIGHT IN A COLD DUNGEON THIS WORD THE QUEEN HATH BIDDEN ME BRING TO THEE NOW RICHARD PARTINGTON QUOTH ROBIN THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT THOU HAST SAVED MY LIFE AND IF THE PROPER TIME EVER COMETH I WILL SHOW THEE THAT ROBIN HOOD NEVER FORGETS THESE THINGS AS FOR THAT BISHOP OF HEREFORD IF I EVER CATCH HIM NIGH TO SHERWOOD AGAIN THINGS WILL BE LIKE TO GO ILL WITH HIM THOU MAYST TELL THE GOOD QUEEN THAT I WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT DELAY AND WILL LET THE LANDLORD THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO SAINT ALBANS BUT WHEN WE ARE UPON THE HIGHROAD AGAIN I WILL GO ONE WAY THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND WILL SEND MY MEN THE OTHER SO THAT IF ONE FALLETH INTO THE KINGS HANDS THE OTHERS MAY HAPLY ESCAPE WE WILL GO BY DEVIOUS WAYS AND SO I HOPE WILL REACH SHERWOOD IN SAFETY AND NOW SIR PAGE I WISH THEE FAREWELL FAREWELL THOU BOLD YEOMAN SAID YOUNG PARTINGTONAND MAYST THOU REACH THY HIDING IN SAFETY SO EACH SHOOK THE OTHERS HAND AND THE LAD TURNING HIS HORSES HEAD RODE BACK TOWARD LONDON WHILE ROBIN ENTERED THE INN ONCE MORE THERE HE FOUND HIS YEOMEN SITTING IN SILENCE WAITING HIS COMING LIKEWISE THE LANDLORD WAS THERE FOR HE WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT MASTER PARTINGTON HAD TO DO WITH THE FELLOW IN BLUE UP MY MERRY MEN QUOTH ROBIN THIS IS NO PLACE FOR US FOR THOSE ARE AFTER US WITH WHOM WE WILL STAND BUT AN ILL CHANCE AN WE FALL INTO THEIR HANDS SO WE WILL GO FORWARD ONCE MORE NOR WILL WE STOP THIS NIGHT TILL WE REACH SAINT ALBANS HEREUPON TAKING OUT HIS PURSE HE PAID THE LANDLORD HIS SCORE AND SO THEY LEFT THE INN WHEN THEY HAD COME TO THE HIGHROAD WITHOUT THE TOWN ROBIN STOPPED AND TOLD THEM ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOUNG PARTINGTON AND HIMSELF AND HOW THAT THE KINGS MEN WERE AFTER THEM WITH HOT HEELS THEN HE TOLD THEM THAT HERE THEY SHOULD PART COMPANY THEY THREE GOING TO THE EASTWARD AND HE TO THE WESTWARD AND SO SKIRTING THE MAIN HIGHROADS WOULD COME BY DEVIOUS PATHS TO SHERWOOD SO BE YE WILY SAID ROBIN HOOD AND KEEP WELL AWAY FROM THE NORTHWARD ROADS TILL YE HAVE GOTTEN WELL TO THE EASTWARD AND THOU WILL SCARLET TAKE THE LEAD OF THE OTHERS FOR THOU HAST A CUNNING TURN TO THY WITS THEN ROBIN KISSED THE THREE UPON THE CHEEKS AND THEY KISSED HIM AND SO THEY PARTED COMPANY NOT LONG AFTER THIS A SCORE OR MORE OF THE KINGS MEN CAME CLATTERING UP TO THE DOOR OF THE INN AT BARNET TOWN HERE THEY LEAPED FROM THEIR HORSES AND QUICKLY SURROUNDEDTHE PLACE THE LEADER OF THE BAND AND FOUR OTHERS ENTERING THE ROOM WHERE THE YEOMEN HAD BEEN BUT THEY FOUND THAT THEIR BIRDS HAD FLOWN AGAIN AND THAT THE KING HAD BEEN BALKED A SECOND TIME METHOUGHT THAT THEY WERE NAUGHTY FELLOWS SAID THE HOST WHEN HE HEARD WHOM THE MEN AT ARMS SOUGHT BUT I HEARD THAT BLUE CLAD KNAVE SAY THAT THEY WOULD GO STRAIGHT FORWARD TO SAINT ALBANS SO AN YE HURRY FORWARD YE MAY PERCHANCE CATCH THEM ON THE HIGHROAD BETWIXT HERE AND THERE FOR THIS NEWS THE LEADER OF THE BAND THANKED MINE HOST RIGHT HEARTILY AND CALLING HIS MEN TOGETHER MOUNTED AND SET FORTH AGAIN GALLOPING FORWARD TO SAINT ALBANS UPON A WILD GOOSE CHASE AFTER LITTLE JOHN AND WILL SCARLET AND ALLAN A DALE HAD LEFT THE HIGHWAY NEAR GARNET THEY TRAVELED TOWARD THE EASTWARD WITHOUT STOPPING AS LONG AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM UNTIL THEY CAME TO CHELMSFORD IN ESSEX THENCE THEY TURNED NORTHWARD AND CAME THROUGH CAMBRIDGE AND LINCOLNSHIRE TO THE GOOD TOWN OF GAINSBOROUGH THEN STRIKING TO THE WESTWARD AND THE SOUTH THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE NORTHERN BORDERS OF SHERWOOD FOREST WITHOUT IN ALL THAT TIME HAVING MET SO MUCH AS A SINGLE BAND OF THE KINGS MEN EIGHT DAYS THEY JOURNEYED THUS ERE THEY REACHED THE WOODLANDS IN SAFETY BUT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE GREENWOOD GLADE THEY FOUND THAT ROBIN HAD NOT YET RETURNED FOR ROBIN WAS NOT AS LUCKY IN GETTING BACK AS HIS MEN HAD BEEN AS YOU SHALL PRESENTLY HEAR AFTER HAVING LEFT THE GREAT NORTHERN ROAD HE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WESTWARD AND SO CAME PAST AYLESBURY TO FAIRWOODSTOCK IN OXFORDSHIRE THENCE HE TURNED HIS FOOTSTEPS NORTHWARD TRAVELING FOR A GREAT DISTANCE BY WAY OF WARWICK TOWN TILL HE CAME TO DUDLEY IN STAFFORDSHIRE SEVEN DAYS IT TOOK HIM TO JOURNEY THUS FAR AND THEN HE THOUGHT HE HAD GOTTEN FAR ENOUGH TO THE NORTH SO TURNING TOWARD THE EASTWARD SHUNNING THE MAIN ROADS AND CHOOSING BYWAYS AND GRASSY LANES HE WENT BY WAY OF LITCHFIELD AND ASHBY DE LA ZOUCH TOWARD SHERWOOD UNTIL HE CAME TO A PLACE CALLED STANTON AND NOW ROBINS HEART BEGAN TO LAUGH ALOUD FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HIS DANGER HAD GONE BY AND THAT HIS NOSTRILS WOULD SOON SNUFF THE SPICY AIR OF THE WOODLANDS ONCE AGAIN BUT THERE IS MANY A SLIP BETWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP AND THIS ROBIN WAS TO FIND FOR THUS IT WAS WHEN THE KINGS MEN FOUND THEMSELVES FOILED AT SAINT ALBANS AND THAT ROBIN AND HIS MEN WERE NOT TO BE FOUND HIGH NOR LOW THEY KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO PRESENTLY ANOTHER BAND OF HORSEMEN CAME AND ANOTHER UNTIL ALL THE MOONLIT STREETS WERE FULL OF ARMED MEN BETWIXT MIDNIGHT AND DAWN ANOTHER BAND CAME TO THE TOWN AND WITH THEM CAME THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD WHEN HE HEARD THAT ROBIN HOOD HAD ONCE MORE SLIPPED OUT OF THE TRAP HE STAYED NOT A MINUTE BUT GATHERING HIS BANDS TOGETHER HE PUSHED FORWARD TO THE NORTHWARD WITH SPEED LEAVING ORDERS FOR ALL THE TROOPS THAT CAME TO SAINT ALBANS TO FOLLOW AFTER HIM WITHOUT TARRYING ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH DAY HE REACHED NOTTINGHAM TOWN AND THERE STRAIGHTWAY DIVIDED HIS MEN INTO BANDS OF SIX OR SEVEN AND SENT THEM ALL THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE BLOCKING EVERY HIGHWAY AND BYWAY TO THE EASTWARD AND THE SOUTHWARD AND THE WESTWARD OF SHERWOOD THE SHERIFF OFNOTTINGHAM CALLED FORTH ALL HIS MEN LIKEWISE AND JOINED WITH THE BISHOP FOR HE SAW THAT THIS WAS THE BEST CHANCE THAT HAD EVER BEFALLEN OF PAYING BACK HIS SCORE IN FULL TO ROBIN HOOD WILL SCARLET AND LITTLE JOHN AND ALLAN A DALE HAD JUST MISSED THE KINGS MEN TO THE EASTWARD FOR THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER THEY HAD PASSED THE LINE AND ENTERED SHERWOOD THE ROADS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD TRAVELED WERE BLOCKED SO THAT HAD THEY TARRIED IN THEIR JOURNEYING THEY WOULD SURELY HAVE FALLEN INTO THE BISHOPS HANDS BUT OF ALL THIS ROBIN KNEW NOT A WHIT SO HE WHISTLED MERRILY AS HE TRUDGED ALONG THE ROAD BEYOND STANTON WITH HIS HEART AS FREE FROM CARE AS THE YOLK OF AN EGG IS FROM COBWEBS AT LAST HE CAME TO WHERE A LITTLE STREAM SPREAD ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHALLOW SHEET TINKLING AND SPARKLING AS IT FRETTED OVER ITS BED OF GOLDEN GRAVEL HERE ROBIN STOPPED BEING ATHIRST AND KNEELING DOWN HE MADE A CUP OF THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS AND BEGAN TO DRINK ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A LONG DISTANCE STOOD TANGLED THICKETS OF BUSHES AND YOUNG TREES AND IT PLEASED ROBINS HEART TO HEAR THE LITTLE BIRDS SINGING THEREIN FOR IT MADE HIM THINK OF SHERWOOD AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A LIFETIME SINCE HE HAD BREATHED THE AIR OF THE WOODLANDS BUT OF A SUDDEN AS HE THUS STOOPED DRINKING SOMETHING HISSED PAST HIS EAR AND STRUCK WITH A SPLASH INTO THE GRAVEL AND WATER BESIDE HIM QUICK AS A WINK ROBIN SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND AT ONE BOUND CROSSED THE STREAM AND THE ROADSIDE AND PLUNGED HEADLONG INTO THE THICKET WITHOUT LOOKING AROUND FOR HE KNEW RIGHT WELL THAT THAT WHICH HAD HISSED SO VENOMOUSLY BESIDE HIS EAR WAS A GRAY GOOSE SHAFT AND THAT TO TARRY SO MUCH ASA MOMENT MEANT DEATH EVEN AS HE LEAPED INTO THE THICKET SIX MORE ARROWS RATTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AFTER HIM ONE OF WHICH PIERCED HIS DOUBLET AND WOULD HAVE STRUCK DEEPLY INTO HIS SIDE BUT FOR THE TOUGH COAT OF STEEL THAT HE WORE THEN UP THE ROAD CAME RIDING SOME OF THE KINGS MEN AT HEADLONG SPEED THEY LEAPED FROM THEIR HORSES AND PLUNGED STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE THICKET AFTER ROBIN BUT ROBIN KNEW THE GROUND BETTER THAN THEY DID SO CRAWLING HERE STOOPING THERE AND ANON RUNNING ACROSS SOME LITTLE OPEN HE SOON LEFT THEM FAR BEHIND COMING OUT AT LAST UPON ANOTHER ROAD ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PACES DISTANT FROM THE ONE HE HAD LEFT HERE HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT LISTENING TO THE DISTANT SHOUTS OF THE SEVEN MEN AS THEY BEAT UP AND DOWN IN THE THICKETS LIKE HOUNDS THAT HAD LOST THE SCENT OF THE QUARRY THEN BUCKLING HIS BELT MORE TIGHTLY AROUND HIS WAIST HE RAN FLEETLY DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD THE EASTWARD AND SHERWOOD BUT ROBIN HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN THREE FURLONGS IN THAT DIRECTION WHEN HE CAME SUDDENLY TO THE BROW OF A HILL AND SAW BENEATH HIM ANOTHER BAND OF THE KINGS MEN SEATED IN THE SHADE ALONG THE ROADSIDE IN THE VALLEY BENEATH THEN HE PAUSED NOT A MOMENT BUT SEEING THAT THEY HAD NOT CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE TURNED AND RAN BACK WHENCE HE HAD COME KNOWING THAT IT WAS BETTER TO RUN THE CHANCE OF ESCAPING THOSE FELLOWS THAT WERE YET IN THE THICKETS THAN TO RUSH INTO THE ARMS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY SO BACK HE RAN WITH ALL SPEED AND HAD GOTTEN SAFELY PAST THE THICKETS WHEN THE SEVEN MEN CAME FORTH INTO THE OPEN ROAD THEY RAISED A GREAT SHOUT WHEN THEY SAW HIM SUCH AS THE HUNTER GIVES WHEN THE DEER BREAKS COVER BUT ROBIN WAS THEN A QUARTER OF A MILEAND MORE AWAY FROM THEM COURSING OVER THE GROUND LIKE A GREYHOUND HE NEVER SLACKENED HIS PACE BUT RAN ALONG MILE AFTER MILE TILL HE HAD COME NIGH TO MACKWORTH OVER BEYOND THE DERWENT RIVER NIGH TO DERBY TOWN HERE SEEING THAT HE WAS OUT OF PRESENT DANGER HE SLACKENED IN HIS RUNNING AND AT LAST SAT

HIM SAFE BEFORE OUR GOOD BISHOP AT TUTBURY TOWN THEREUPON THEY TIED THE COBBLERS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND LED HIM OFF WITH A ROPE AS THE FARMER LEADS OFF THE CALF HE HATH BROUGHT FROM THE FAIR ROBIN STOOD LOOKING AFTER THEM AND WHEN THEY WERE GONE HE LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS FOR HE KNEW THAT NO HARM WOULD BEFALL THE HONEST FELLOW AND HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF THE BISHOPS FACE WHEN GOOD QUINCE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AS ROBIN HOOD THEN TURNING HIS STEPS ONCE MORE TO THE EASTWARD HE STEPPED OUT RIGHT FOOT FOREMOST TOWARD NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND SHERWOOD FOREST BUT ROBIN HOOD HAD GONE THROUGH MORE THAN HE WOTTED OF HIS JOURNEY FROM LONDON HAD BEEN HARD AND LONG AND IN A SEENNIGHT HE HAD TRAVELED SEVENSCORE AND MORE OF MILES HE THOUGHT NOW TO TRAVEL ON WITHOUT STOPPING UNTIL HE HAD COME TO SHERWOOD BUT ERE HE HAD GONE A HALF A SCORE OF MILES HE FELT HIS STRENGTH GIVING WAY BENEATH HIM LIKE A RIVER BANK WHICH THE WATERS HAVE UNDERMINED HESAT HIM DOWN AND RESTED BUT HE KNEW WITHIN HIMSELF THAT HE COULD GO NO FARTHER THAT DAY FOR HIS FEET FELT LIKE LUMPS OF LEAD SO HEAVY WERE THEY WITH WEARINESS ONCE MORE HE AROSE AND WENT FORWARD BUT AFTER TRAVELING A COUPLE OF MILES HE WAS FAIN TO GIVE THE MATTER UP SO COMING TO AN INN JUST THEN HE ENTERED AND CALLING THE LANDLORD BADE HIM SHOW HIM TO A ROOM ALTHOUGH THE SUN WAS ONLY THEN JUST SINKING IN THE WESTERN SKY THERE WERE BUT THREE BEDROOMS IN THE PLACE AND TO THE MEANEST OF THESE THE LANDLORD SHOWED ROBIN HOOD BUT LITTLE ROBIN CARED FOR THE LOOKS OF THE PLACE FOR HE COULD HAVE SLEPT THAT NIGHT UPON A BED OF BROKEN STONES SO STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES WITHOUT MORE ADO HE ROLLED INTO THE BED AND WAS ASLEEP ALMOST ERE HIS HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW NOT LONG AFTER ROBIN HAD SO GONE TO HIS REST A GREAT CLOUD PEEPED BLACKLY OVER THE HILLS TO THE WESTWARD HIGHER AND HIGHER IT AROSE UNTIL IT PILED UP INTO THE NIGHT LIKE A MOUNTAIN OF DARKNESS ALL AROUND BENEATH IT CAME EVER AND ANON A DULL RED FLASH AND PRESENTLY A SHORT GRIM MUTTER OF THE COMING THUNDER WAS HEARD THEN UP RODE FOUR STOUT BURGHERS OF NOTTINGHAM TOWN FOR THIS WAS THE ONLY INN WITHIN FIVE MILES DISTANCE AND THEY DID NOT CARE TO BE CAUGHT IN SUCH A THUNDERSTORM AS THIS THAT WAS COMING UPON THEM LEAVING THEIR NAGS TO THE STABLEMAN THEY ENTERED THE BEST ROOM OF THE INN WHERE FRESH GREEN RUSHES LAY ALL SPREAD UPON THE FLOOR AND THERE CALLED FOR THE GOODLIEST FARE THAT THE PLACE AFFORDED AFTER HAVING EATEN HEARTILY THEY BADE THE LANDLORD SHOW THEM TO THEIR ROOMS FOR THEY WERE AWEARY HAVING RIDDEN ALL THE WAY FROM DRONFIELD THAT DAY SO OFFTHEY WENT GRUMBLING AT HAVING TO SLEEP TWO IN A BED BUT THEIR TROUBLES ON THIS SCORE AS WELL AS ALL OTHERS WERE SOON LOST IN THE QUIETNESS OF SLEEP AND NOW CAME THE FIRST GUST OF WIND RUSHING PAST THE PLACE CLAPPING AND BANGING THE DOORS AND SHUTTERS SMELLING OF THE COMING RAIN AND ALL WRAPPED IN A CLOUD OF DUST AND LEAVES AS THOUGH THE WIND HAD BROUGHT A GUEST ALONG WITH IT THE DOOR OPENED OF A SUDDEN AND IN CAME A FRIAR OF EMMET PRIORY AND ONE IN HIGH DEGREE AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SOFTNESS AND SLEEKNESS OF HIS ROBES AND THE RICHNESS OF HIS ROSARY HE CALLED TO THE LANDLORD AND BADE HIM FIRST HAVE HIS MULE WELL FED AND BEDDED IN THE STABLE AND THEN TO BRING HIM THE VERY BEST THERE WAS IN THE HOUSE SO PRESENTLY A SAVORY STEW OF TRIPE AND ONIONS WITH SWEET LITTLE FAT DUMPLINGS WAS SET BEFORE HIM LIKEWISE A GOOD STOUT POTTLE OF MALMSEY AND STRAIGHTWAY THE HOLY FRIAR FELL TO WITH GREAT COURAGE AND HEARTINESS SO THAT IN A SHORT TIME NOUGHT WAS LEFT BUT A LITTLE POOL OF GRAVY IN THE CENTER OF THE PLATTER NOT LARGE ENOW TO KEEP THE LIFE IN A STARVING MOUSE IN THE MEANTIME THE STORM BROKE ANOTHER GUST OF WIND WENT RUSHING BY AND WITH IT FELL A FEW HEAVY DROPS OF RAIN WHICH PRESENTLY CAME RATTLING DOWN IN SHOWERS BEATING AGAINST THE CASEMENTS LIKE A HUNDRED LITTLE HANDS BRIGHT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING LIT UP EVERY RAINDROP AND WITH THEM CAME CRACKS OF THUNDER THAT WENT AWAY RUMBLING AND BUMPING AS THOUGH SAINT SWITHIN WERE BUSY ROLLING GREAT CASKS OF WATER ACROSS ROUGH GROUND OVERHEAD THE WOMENFOLKS SCREAMED AND THE MERRY WAGS IN THE TAPROOM PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND THEIR WAISTS TO SOOTHE THEM INTO QUIETNESS AT LAST THE HOLY FRIAR BADE THE LANDLORD SHOW HIM TO HIS ROOM BUT WHEN HE HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BED WITH A COBBLER HE WAS AS ILL CONTENTED A FELLOW AS YOU COULD FIND IN ALL ENGLAND NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT AND HE MUST SLEEP THERE OR NOWHERE SO TAKING UP HIS CANDLE HE WENT OFF GRUMBLING LIKE THE NOW DISTANT THUNDER WHEN HE CAME TO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS TO SLEEP HE HELD THE LIGHT OVER ROBIN AND LOOKED AT HIM FROM TOP TO TOE THEN HE FELT BETTER PLEASED FOR INSTEAD OF A ROUGH DIRTY BEARDED FELLOW HE BEHELD AS FRESH AND CLEAN A LAD AS ONE COULD FIND IN A WEEK OF SUNDAYS SO SLIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES HE ALSO HUDDLED INTO THE BED WHERE ROBIN GRUNTING AND GRUMBLING IN HIS SLEEP MADE ROOM FOR HIM ROBIN WAS MORE SOUND ASLEEP I WOT THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR MANY A DAY ELSE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE RESTED SO QUIETLY WITH ONE OF THE FRIARS SORT SO CLOSE BESIDE HIM AS FOR THE FRIAR HAD HE KNOWN WHO ROBIN HOOD WAS YOU MAY WELL BELIEVE HE WOULD ALMOST AS SOON HAVE SLEPT WITH AN ADDER AS WITH THE MAN HE HAD FOR A BEDFELLOW SO THE NIGHT PASSED COMFORTABLY ENOUGH BUT AT THE FIRST DAWN OF DAY ROBIN OPENED HIS EYES AND TURNED HIS HEAD UPON THE PILLOW THEN HOW HE GAPED AND HOW HE STARED FOR THERE BESIDE HIM LAY ONE ALL SHAVEN AND SHORN SO THAT HE KNEW THAT IT MUST BE A FELLOW IN HOLY ORDERS HE PINCHED HIMSELF SHARPLY BUT FINDING HE WAS AWAKE SAT UP IN BED WHILE THE OTHER SLUMBERED AS PEACEFULLY AS THOUGH HE WERE SAFE AND SOUND AT HOME IN EMMET PRIORY NOW QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF I WONDER HOW THIS THING HATH DROPPED INTO MY BED DURING THE NIGHT SO SAYING HE AROSE SOFTLY SO AS NOTTO WAKEN THE OTHER AND LOOKING ABOUT THE ROOM HE ESPIED THE FRIARS CLOTHES LYING UPON A BENCH NEAR THE WALL FIRST HE LOOKED AT THE CLOTHES WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND THEN HE LOOKED AT THE FRIAR AND SLOWLY WINKED ONE EYE QUOTH HE GOOD BROTHER WHAT EER THY NAME MAY BE AS THOU HAST BORROWED MY BED SO FREELY ILL EEN BORROW THY CLOTHES IN RETURN SO SAYING HE STRAIGHTWAY DONNED THE HOLY MANS GARB BUT KINDLY LEFT THE COBBLERS CLOTHES IN THE PLACE OF IT THEN HE WENT FORTH INTO THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING AND THE STABLEMAN THAT WAS UP AND ABOUT THE STABLES OPENED HIS EYES AS THOUGH HE SAW A GREEN MOUSE BEFORE HIM FOR SUCH MEN AS THE FRIARS OF EMMET WERE NOT WONT TO BE EARLY RISERS BUT THE MAN BOTTLED HIS THOUGHTS AND ONLY ASKED ROBIN WHETHER HE WANTED HIS MULE BROUGHT FROM THE STABLE YEA MY SON QUOTH ROBIN ALBEIT HE KNEW NOUGHT OF THE MULE AND BRING IT FORTH QUICKLY I PRYTHEE FOR I AM LATE AND MUST BE JOGGING SO PRESENTLY THE STABLEMAN BROUGHT FORTH THE MULE AND ROBIN MOUNTED IT AND WENT ON HIS WAY REJOICING AS FOR THE HOLY FRIAR WHEN HE AROSE HE WAS IN AS PRETTY A STEW AS ANY MAN IN ALL THE WORLD FOR HIS RICH SOFT ROBES WERE GONE LIKEWISE HIS PURSE WITH TEN GOLDEN POUNDS IN IT AND NOUGHT WAS LEFT BUT PATCHED CLOTHES AND A LEATHERN APRON HE RAGED AND SWORE LIKE ANY LAYMAN BUT AS HIS SWEARING MENDED NOTHING AND THE LANDLORD COULD NOT AID HIM AND AS MOREOVER HE WAS FORCED TO BE AT EMMET PRIORY THAT VERY MORNING UPON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HE WAS FAIN EITHER TO DON THE COBBLERS CLOTHES OR TRAVEL THE ROAD IN NAKEDNESS SO HE PUT ON THE CLOTHES AND STILL RAGING AND SWEARING VENGEANCEAGAINST ALL THE COBBLERS IN DERBYSHIRE HE SET FORTH UPON HIS WAY AFOOT BUT HIS ILLS HAD NOT YET DONE WITH HIM FOR HE HAD NOT GONE FAR ERE HE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE KINGS MEN WHO MARCHED HIM OFF WILLY NILLY TO TUTBURY TOWN AND THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD IN VAIN HE SWORE HE WAS A HOLY MAN AND SHOWED HIS SHAVEN CROWN OFF HE MUST GO FOR NOTHING WOULD DO BUT THAT HE WAS ROBIN HOOD MEANWHILE MERRY ROBIN RODE ALONG CONTENTEDLY PASSING SAFELY BY TWO BANDS OF THE KINGS MEN UNTIL HIS HEART BEGAN TO DANCE WITHIN HIM BECAUSE OF THE NEARNESS OF SHERWOOD SO HE TRAVELED EVER ON TO THE EASTWARD TILL OF A SUDDEN HE MET A NOBLE KNIGHT IN A SHADY LANE THEN ROBIN CHECKED HIS MULE QUICKLY AND LEAPED FROM OFF ITS BACK NOW WELL MET SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA CRIED HE FOR RATHER THAN ANY OTHER MAN IN ENGLAND WOULD I SEE THY GOOD FACE THIS DAY THEN HE TOLD SIR RICHARD ALL THE HAPPENINGS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND THAT NOW AT LAST HE FELT HIMSELF SAFE BEING SO NIGH TO SHERWOOD AGAIN BUT WHEN ROBIN HAD DONE SIR RICHARD SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY THOU ART IN GREATER DANGER NOW ROBIN THAN THOU HAST YET BEEN SAID HE FOR BEFORE THEE LIE BANDS OF THE SHERIFFS MEN BLOCKING EVERY ROAD AND LETTING NONE PASS THROUGH THE LINES WITHOUT EXAMINING THEM CLOSELY I MYSELF KNOW THIS HAVING PASSED THEM BUT NOW BEFORE THEE LIE THE SHERIFFS MEN AND BEHIND THEE THE KINGS MEN AND THOU CANST NOT HOPE TO PASS EITHER WAY FOR BY THIS TIME THEY WILL KNOW OF THY DISGUISE AND WILL BE IN WAITING TO SEIZE UPON THEE MY CASTLE AND EVERYTHING WITHIN IT ARE THINE BUT NOUGHT COULD BE GAINED THERE FOR I COULD NOT HOPE TO HOLD IT AGAINST SUCH A FORCE AS IS NOW IN NOTTINGHAMOF THE KINGS AND THE SHERIFFS MEN HAVING SO SPOKEN SIR RICHARD BENT HIS HEAD IN THOUGHT AND ROBIN FELT HIS HEART SINK WITHIN HIM LIKE THAT OF THE FOX THAT HEARS THE HOUNDS AT HIS HEELS AND FINDS HIS DEN BLOCKED WITH EARTH SO THAT THERE IS NO HIDING FOR HIM BUT PRESENTLY SIR RICHARD SPOKE AGAIN SAYING ONE THING THOU CANST DO ROBIN AND ONE ONLY GO BACK TO LONDON AND THROW THYSELF UPON THE MERCY OF OUR GOOD QUEEN ELEANOR COME WITH ME STRAIGHTWAY TO MY CASTLE DOFF THESE CLOTHES AND PUT ON SUCH AS MY RETAINERS WEAR THEN I WILL HIE ME TO LONDON TOWN WITH A TROOP OF MEN BEHIND ME AND THOU SHALT MINGLE WITH THEM AND THUS WILL I BRING THEE TO WHERE THOU MAYST SEE AND SPEAK WITH THE QUEEN THY ONLY HOPE IS TO GET TO SHERWOOD FOR THERE NONE CAN REACH THEE AND THOU WILT NEVER GET TO SHERWOOD BUT IN THIS WAY SO ROBIN WENT WITH SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA AND DID AS HE SAID FOR HE SAW THE WISDOM OF THAT WHICH THE KNIGHT ADVISED AND THAT THIS WAS HIS ONLY CHANCE OF SAFETY QUEEN ELEANOR WALKED IN HER ROYAL GARDEN AMID THE ROSES THAT BLOOMED SWEETLY AND WITH HER WALKED SIX OF HER LADIES IN WAITING CHATTERING BLITHELY TOGETHER OF A SUDDEN A MAN LEAPED UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN HANGING FOR A MOMENT DROPPED LIGHTLY UPON THE GRASS WITHIN ALL THE LADIES IN WAITING SHRIEKED AT THE SUDDENNESS OF HIS COMING BUT THE MAN RAN TO THE QUEEN AND KNEELED AT HER FEET AND SHE SAW THAT IT WAS ROBIN HOOD WHY HOW NOW ROBIN CRIED SHE DOST THOU DARE TO COME INTO THE VERY JAWS OF THE RAGING LION ALAS POOR FELLOW THOU ART LOST INDEED IF THE KING FINDS THEE HERE DOSTTHOU NOT KNOW THAT HE IS SEEKING THEE THROUGH ALL THE LAND YEA QUOTH ROBIN I DO KNOW RIGHT WELL THAT THE KING SEEKS ME AND THEREFORE I HAVE COME FOR SURELY NO ILL CAN BEFALL ME WHEN HE HATH PLEDGED HIS ROYAL WORD TO YOUR MAJESTY FOR MY SAFETY MOREOVER I KNOW YOUR MAJESTYS KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS OF HEART AND SO I LAY MY LIFE FREELY IN YOUR GRACIOUS HANDS I TAKE THY MEANING ROBIN HOOD SAID THE QUEEN AND THAT THOU DOST CONVEY REPROACH TO ME AS WELL THOU MAYST FOR I KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT DONE BY THEE AS I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE I KNOW RIGHT WELL THAT THOU MUST HAVE BEEN HARD PRESSED BY PERIL TO LEAP SO BOLDLY INTO ONE DANGER TO ESCAPE ANOTHER ONCE MORE I PROMISE THEE MINE AID AND WILL DO ALL I CAN TO SEND THEE BACK IN SAFETY TO SHERWOOD FOREST BIDE THOU HERE TILL I RETURN SO SAYING SHE LEFT ROBIN IN THE GARDEN OF ROSES AND WAS GONE A LONG TIME WHEN SHE CAME BACK SIR ROBERT LEE WAS WITH HER AND THE QUEENS CHEEKS WERE HOT AND THE QUEENS EYES WERE BRIGHT AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH HIGH WORDS THEN SIR ROBERT CAME STRAIGHT FORWARD TO WHERE ROBIN HOOD STOOD AND HE SPOKE TO THE YEOMAN IN A COLD STERN VOICE QUOTH HE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN THE KING HATH MITIGATED HIS WRATH TOWARD THEE FELLOW AND HATH ONCE MORE PROMISED THAT THOU SHALT DEPART IN PEACE AND SAFETY NOT ONLY HATH HE PROMISED THIS BUT IN THREE DAYS HE WILL SEND ONE OF HIS PAGES TO GO WITH THEE AND SEE THAT NONE ARREST THY JOURNEY BACK AGAIN THOU MAYST THANK THY PATRON SAINT THAT THOU HAST SUCH A GOOD FRIEND IN OUR NOBLE QUEEN FOR BUT FOR HER PERSUASION AND ARGUMENTS THOU HADST BEEN A DEAD MAN I CAN TELL THEELET THIS PERIL THAT THOU HAST PASSED THROUGH TEACH THEE TWO LESSONS FIRST BE MORE HONEST SECOND BE NOT SO BOLD IN THY COMINGS AND GOINGS A MAN THAT WALKETH IN THE DARKNESS AS THOU DOST MAY ESCAPE FOR A TIME BUT IN THE END HE WILL SURELY FALL INTO THE PIT THOU HAST PUT THY HEAD IN THE ANGRY LIONS MOUTH AND YET THOU HAST ESCAPED BY A MIRACLE TRY IT NOT AGAIN SO SAYING HE TURNED AND LEFT ROBIN AND WAS GONE FOR THREE DAYS ROBIN ABIDED IN LONDON IN THE QUEENS HOUSEHOLD AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE KINGS HEAD PAGE EDWARD CUNNINGHAM CAME AND TAKING ROBIN WITH HIM DEPARTED NORTHWARD UPON HIS WAY TO SHERWOOD NOW AND THEN THEY PASSED BANDS OF THE KINGS MEN COMING BACK AGAIN TO LONDON BUT NONE OF THOSE BANDS STOPPED THEM AND SO AT LAST THEY REACHED THE SWEET LEAFY WOODLANDSROBIN HOOD AND GUY OF GISBOURNE ALONG TIME PASSED AFTER THE GREAT SHOOTING MATCH AND DURING THAT TIME ROBIN FOLLOWED ONE PART OF THE ADVICE OF SIR ROBERT LEE TO WIT THAT OF BEING LESS BOLD IN HIS COMINGS AND HIS GOINGS FOR THOUGH MAYHAP HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MORE HONEST AS MOST FOLKS REGARD HONESTY HE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO TRAVEL SO FAR FROM SHERWOOD THAT HE COULD NOT REACH IT BOTH EASILY AND QUICKLY GREAT CHANGES HAD FALLEN IN THIS TIME FOR KING HENRY HAD DIED AND KING RICHARD HAD COME TO THE CROWN THAT FITTED HIM SO WELL THROUGH MANY HARD TRIALS AND THROUGH ADVENTURES AS STIRRING AS ANY THAT EVER BEFELL ROBIN HOOD BUT THOUGH GREAT CHANGES CAME THEY DID NOT REACH TO SHERWOODS SHADES FOR THERE ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MEN DWELLED AS MERRILY AS THEY HAD EVER DONE WITH HUNTING AND FEASTING AND SINGING AND BLITHE WOODLAND SPORTS FOR IT WAS LITTLE THE OUTSIDE STRIVING OF THE WORLD TROUBLED THEM THE DAWNING OF A SUMMERS DAY WAS FRESH AND BRIGHT AND THE BIRDS SANG SWEETLY IN A GREAT TUMULT OF SOUND SO LOUD WAS THEIR SINGING THAT IT AWAKENED ROBIN HOOD WHERE HE LAY SLEEPING SO THAT HE STIRRED AND TURNED AND AROSE UP ROSE LITTLE JOHN ALSO AND ALL THE MERRY MEN THEN AFTER THEY HAD BROKEN THEIR FAST THEY SET FORTH HITHER AND THITHER UPONTHE DOINGS OF THE DAY ROBIN HOOD AND LITTLE JOHN WALKED DOWN A FOREST PATH WHERE ALL AROUND THE LEAVES DANCED AND TWINKLED AS THE BREEZE TREMBLED THROUGH THEM AND THE SUNLIGHT CAME FLICKERING DOWN QUOTH ROBIN HOOD I MAKE MY VOW LITTLE JOHN MY BLOOD TICKLES MY VEINS AS IT FLOWS THROUGH THEM THIS GAY MORN WHAT SAYST THOU TO OUR SEEKING ADVENTURES EACH ONE UPON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WITH ALL MY HEART SAID LITTLE JOHN WE HAVE HAD MORE THAN ONE PLEASANT DOING IN THAT WAY GOOD MASTER HERE ARE TWO PATHS TAKE THOU THE ONE TO THE RIGHT HAND AND I WILL TAKE THE ONE TO THE LEFT AND THEN LET US EACH WALK STRAIGHT AHEAD TILL HE TUMBLE INTO SOME MERRY DOING OR OTHER I LIKE THY PLAN QUOTH ROBIN THEREFORE WE WILL PART HERE BUT LOOK THEE LITTLE JOHN KEEP THYSELF OUT OF MISCHIEF FOR I WOULD NOT HAVE ILL BEFALL THEE FOR ALL THE WORLD MARRY COME UP QUOTH LITTLE JOHN HOW THOU TALKEST METHINKS THOU ART WONT TO GET THYSELF

THERE FIELDS OF BARLEY CORN OR GREEN MEADOW LANDS LAY SMILING IN THE SUN SO HE CAME TO THE HIGHROADAND TO WHERE A LITTLE THATCHED COTTAGE STOOD BACK OF A CLUSTER OF TWISTED CRAB TREES WITH FLOWERS IN FRONT OF IT HERE HE STOPPED OF A SUDDEN FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD THE SOUND OF SOMEONE IN SORROW HE LISTENED AND FOUND THAT IT CAME FROM THE COTTAGE SO TURNING HIS FOOTSTEPS THITHER HE PUSHED OPEN THE WICKET AND ENTERED THE PLACE THERE HE SAW A GRAY HAIRED DAME SITTING BESIDE A COLD HEARTHSTONE ROCKING HERSELF TO AND FRO AND WEEPING BITTERLY NOW LITTLE JOHN HAD A TENDER HEART FOR THE SORROWS OF

SUCH A WONDROUS SWEET VOICE THATIT STRANGELY MOVES MY HEART BUT WHAT DOLEFUL DITTY IS THIS FOR THE LIPS OF A STOUT YEOMAN I WOULD RATHER HEAR THEE SING A SONG OF LOVE AND BATTLE THAN A SAD THING LIKE

HE WAS THE BEST MINSTREL THAT EVER I HEARD BUT NOW ONE CAME FORWARD AND SAID THAT THE FEAST WAS READY SO ROBIN HOOD BROUGHT KING RICHARD AND THOSE WITH HIM TO WHERE IT LAY ALL SPREAD OUT ON FAIR WHITE LINEN CLOTHS WHICH LAY UPON THE SOFT GREEN GRASS THEN KING RICHARD SAT HIM DOWN AND FEASTED AND DRANK AND WHEN HE WAS DONE HE SWORE ROUNDLY THAT HE HAD NEVER SAT AT SUCH A LUSTY REPAST IN ALL HIS LIFE BEFORE THAT NIGHT HE LAY IN SHERWOOD FOREST UPON A BED OF SWEET GREEN LEAVES AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING HE SET FORTH FROM THE WOODLANDS FOR NOTTINGHAM TOWN ROBIN HOOD AND ALL OF HIS BAND GOING WITH HIM YOU MAY GUESS WHAT A STIR THERE WAS IN THE GOOD TOWN WHEN ALL THESE FAMOUS OUTLAWS CAME MARCHING INTO THE STREETS AS FOR THE SHERIFF HE KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY NOR WHERE TO LOOK WHEN HE SAW ROBIN HOOD IN SUCH HIGH FAVOR WITH THE KING WHILE ALL HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH GALL BECAUSE OF THE VEXATION THAT LAY UPON HIM THE NEXT DAY THE KING TOOK LEAVE OF NOTTINGHAM TOWNSO ROBIN HOOD AND LITTLE JOHN AND WILL SCARLET AND ALLAN A DALE SHOOK HANDS WITH ALL THE REST OF THE BAND KISSING THE CHEEKS OF EACH MAN AND SWEARING THAT THEY WOULD OFTEN COME TO SHERWOOD AND SEE THEM THEN EACH MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY IN THE TRAIN OF THE KINGEPILOGUE THUS END THE MERRY ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD FOR IN SPITE OF HIS PROMISE IT WAS MANY A YEAR ERE HE SAW SHERWOOD AGAIN AFTER A YEAR OR TWO AT COURT LITTLE JOHN CAME BACK TO NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WHERE HE LIVED IN AN ORDERLY WAY THOUGH WITHIN SIGHT OF SHERWOOD AND WHERE HE ACHIEVED GREAT FAME AS THE CHAMPION OF ALL ENGLAND WITH THE QUARTERSTAFF WILL SCARLET AFTER A TIME CAME BACK TO HIS OWN HOME WHENCE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN BY HIS UNLUCKY KILLING OF HIS FATHERS STEWARD THE REST OF THE BAND DID THEIR DUTY AS ROYAL RANGERS RIGHT WELL BUT ROBIN HOOD AND ALLAN A DALE DID NOT COME AGAIN TO SHERWOOD SO QUICKLY FOR THUS IT WAS ROBIN THROUGH HIS GREAT FAME AS AN ARCHER BECAME A FAVORITE WITH THE KING SO THAT HE SPEEDILY ROSE IN RANK TO BE THE CHIEF OF ALL THE YEOMEN AT LAST THE KING SEEING HOW FAITHFUL AND HOW LOYAL HE WAS CREATED HIM EARL OF HUNTINGDON SO ROBIN FOLLOWED THE KING TO THE WARS AND FOUND HIS TIME SO FULL THAT HE HAD NO CHANCE TO COME BACK TO SHERWOOD FOR EVEN SO MUCH AS A DAY AS FOR ALLAN A DALE AND HIS WIFE THE FAIR ELLEN THEY FOLLOWED ROBIN HOOD AND SHARED IN ALL HIS UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE AND NOW DEAR FRIEND YOU WHO HAVE JOURNEYED WITH ME IN ALL THESE MERRY DOINGS I WILL NOT BID YOU FOLLOW ME FURTHER BUT WILL DROP YOUR HAND HERE WITH A GOOD DEN IFYOU WISH IT FOR THAT WHICH COMETH HEREAFTER SPEAKS OF THE BREAKING UP OF THINGS AND SHOWS HOW JOYS AND PLEASURES THAT ARE DEAD AND GONE CAN NEVER BE SET UPON THEIR FEET TO WALK AGAIN I WILL NOT DWELL UPON THE MATTER OVERLONG BUT WILL TELL AS SPEEDILY AS MAY BE OF HOW THAT STOUT FELLOW ROBIN HOOD DIED AS HE HAD LIVED NOT AT COURT AS EARL OF HUNTINGDON BUT WITH BOW IN HAND HIS HEART IN THE GREENWOOD AND HE HIMSELF A RIGHT YEOMAN KING RICHARD DIED UPON THE BATTLEFIELD IN SUCH A WAY AS PROPERLY BECAME A LION HEARTED KING AS YOU YOURSELF NO DOUBT KNOW SO AFTER A TIME THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON OR ROBIN HOOD AS WE STILL CALL HIM AS OF OLD FINDING NOTHING FOR HIS DOING ABROAD CAME BACK TO MERRY ENGLAND AGAIN WITH HIM CAME ALLAN A DALE AND HIS WIFE THE FAIR ELLEN FOR THESE TWO HAD BEEN CHIEF OF ROBINS HOUSEHOLD EVER SINCE HE HAD LEFT SHERWOOD FOREST IT WAS IN THE SPRINGTIME WHEN THEY LANDED ONCE MORE ON THE SHORES OF ENGLAND THE LEAVES WERE GREEN AND THE SMALL BIRDS SANG BLITHELY JUST AS THEY USED TO DO IN FAIR SHERWOOD WHEN ROBIN HOOD ROAMED THE WOODLAND SHADES WITH A FREE HEART AND A LIGHT HEEL ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE TIME AND THE JOYOUSNESS OF EVERYTHING BROUGHT BACK TO ROBINS MIND HIS FOREST LIFE SO THAT A GREAT LONGING CAME UPON HIM TO BEHOLD THE WOODLANDS ONCE MORE SO HE WENT STRAIGHTWAY TO KING JOHN AND BESOUGHT LEAVE OF HIM TO VISIT NOTTINGHAM FOR A SHORT SEASON THE KING GAVE HIM LEAVE TO COME AND TO GO BUT BADE HIM NOT STAY LONGER THAN THREE DAYS AT SHERWOOD SO ROBIN HOOD AND ALLAN A DALE SET FORTH WITHOUT DELAY TO NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND SHERWOOD FORESTTHE FIRST NIGHT THEY TOOK UP THEIR INN AT NOTTINGHAM TOWN YET THEY DID NOT GO TO PAY THEIR DUTY TO THE SHERIFF FOR HIS WORSHIP BORE MANY A BITTER GRUDGE AGAINST ROBIN HOOD WHICH GRUDGES HAD NOT BEEN LESSENED BY ROBINS RISE IN THE WORLD THE NEXT DAY AT AN EARLY HOUR THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND SET FORTH FOR THE WOODLANDS AS THEY PASSED ALONG THE ROAD IT SEEMED TO ROBIN THAT HE KNEW EVERY STICK AND STONE THAT HIS EYES LOOKED UPON YONDER WAS A PATH THAT HE HAD OFTTIMES TROD OF A MELLOW EVENING WITH LITTLE JOHN BESIDE HIM HERE WAS ONE NOW NIGH CHOKED WITH BRAMBLES ALONG WHICH HE AND A LITTLE BAND HAD WALKED WHEN THEY WENT FORTH TO SEEK A CERTAIN CURTAL FRIAR THUS THEY RODE SLOWLY ONWARD TALKING ABOUT THESE OLD FAMILIAR THINGS OLD AND YET NEW FOR THEY FOUND MORE IN THEM THAN THEY HAD EVER THOUGHT OF BEFORE THUS AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE OPEN GLADE AND THE BROAD WIDE SPREADING GREENWOOD TREE WHICH WAS THEIR HOME FOR SO MANY YEARS NEITHER OF THE TWO SPOKE WHEN THEY STOOD BENEATH THAT TREE ROBIN LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AT THE WELL KNOWN THINGS SO LIKE WHAT THEY USED TO BE AND YET SO DIFFERENT FOR WHERE ONCE WAS THE BUSTLE OF MANY BUSY FELLOWS WAS NOW THE QUIETNESS OF SOLITUDE AND AS HE LOOKED THE WOODLANDS THE GREENSWARD AND THE SKY ALL BLURRED TOGETHER IN HIS SIGHT THROUGH SALT TEARS FOR SUCH A GREAT YEARNING CAME UPON HIM AS HE LOOKED ON THESE THINGS AS WELL KNOWN TO HIM AS THE FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP BACK THE WATER FROM HIS EYES THAT MORNING HE HAD SLUNG HIS GOOD OLD BUGLE HORN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND NOW WITH THE YEARNING CAME A GREAT LONGING TO SOUND HIS BUGLE ONCE MORE HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS HE BLEW A BLAST TIRILA LIRILA THE SWEET CLEAR NOTES WENT WINDING DOWN THE FOREST PATHS COMING BACK AGAIN FROM THE MORE DISTANT BOSKY SHADES IN FAINT ECHOES OF SOUND TIRILA LIRILA TIRILA LIRILA UNTIL IT FADED AWAY AND WAS LOST NOW IT CHANCED THAT ON THAT VERY MORN LITTLE JOHN WAS WALKING THROUGH A SPUR OF THE FOREST UPON CERTAIN MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND AS HE PACED ALONG SUNK IN MEDITATION THE FAINT CLEAR NOTES OF A DISTANT BUGLE HORN CAME TO HIS EAR AS LEAPS THE STAG WHEN IT FEELS THE ARROW AT ITS HEART SO LEAPED LITTLE JOHN WHEN THAT DISTANT SOUND MET HIS EAR ALL THE BLOOD IN HIS BODY SEEMED TO RUSH LIKE A FLAME INTO HIS CHEEKS AS HE BENT HIS HEAD AND LISTENED AGAIN CAME THE BUGLE NOTE THIN AND CLEAR AND YET AGAIN IT SOUNDED THEN LITTLE JOHN GAVE A GREAT WILD CRY OF YEARNING OF JOY AND YET OF GRIEF AND PUTTING DOWN HIS HEAD HE DASHED INTO THE THICKET ONWARD HE PLUNGED CRACKLING AND RENDING AS THE WILD BOAR RUSHES THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH LITTLE RECKED HE OF THORNS AND BRIERS THAT SCRATCHED HIS FLESH AND TORE HIS CLOTHING FOR ALL HE THOUGHT OF WAS TO GET BY THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE GREENWOOD GLADE WHENCE HE KNEW THE SOUND OF THE BUGLE HORN CAME OUT HE BURST FROM THE COVERT AT LAST A SHOWER OF LITTLE BROKEN TWIGS FALLING ABOUT HIM AND WITHOUT PAUSING A MOMENT RUSHED FORWARD AND FLUNG HIMSELF AT ROBINS FEET THEN HE CLASPED HIS ARMS AROUND THE MASTERS KNEES AND ALL HIS BODY WAS SHAKEN WITH GREAT SOBS NEITHER COULD ROBIN NOR ALLAN A DALE SPEAK BUT STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT LITTLE JOHN THE TEARS ROLLING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS WHILE THEY THUS STOOD SEVEN ROYAL RANGERS RUSHED INTOTHE OPEN GLADE AND RAISED A GREAT SHOUT OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF ROBIN AND AT THEIR HEAD WAS WILL STUTELY THEN AFTER A WHILE CAME FOUR MORE PANTING WITH THEIR RUNNING AND TWO OF THESE FOUR WERE WILL SCATHELOCK AND MIDGE THE MILLER FOR ALL OF THESE HAD HEARD THE SOUND OF ROBIN HOODS HORN ALL THESE RAN TO ROBIN AND KISSED HIS HANDS AND HIS CLOTHING WITH GREAT SOUND OF WEEPING AFTER A WHILE ROBIN LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH TEARDIMMED EYES AND SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE NOW I SWEAR THAT NEVER AGAIN WILL I LEAVE THESE DEAR WOODLANDS I HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM THEM AND FROM YOU TOO LONG NOW DO I LAY BY THE NAME OF ROBERT EARL OF HUNTINGDON AND TAKE UPON ME ONCE AGAIN THAT NOBLER TITLE ROBIN HOOD THE YEOMAN AT THIS A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP AND ALL THE YEOMEN SHOOK ONE ANOTHERS HANDS FOR JOY THE NEWS THAT ROBIN HOOD HAD COME BACK AGAIN TO DWELL IN SHERWOOD AS OF OLD SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE SO THAT ERE A SEENNIGHT HAD PASSED NEARLY ALL OF HIS OLD YEOMEN HAD GATHERED ABOUT HIM AGAIN BUT WHEN THE NEWS OF ALL THIS REACHED THE EARS OF KING JOHN HE SWORE BOTH LOUD AND DEEP AND TOOK A SOLEMN VOW THAT HE WOULD NOT REST UNTIL HE HAD ROBIN HOOD IN HIS POWER DEAD OR ALIVE NOW THERE WAS PRESENT AT COURT A CERTAIN KNIGHT SIR WILLIAM DALE AS GALLANT A SOLDIER AS EVER DONNED HARNESS SIR WILLIAM DALE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH SHERWOOD FOREST FOR HE WAS HEAD KEEPER OVER THAT PART OF IT THAT LAY NIGH TO GOOD MANSFIELD TOWN SO TO HIM THE KING TURNED AND BADE HIM TAKE AN ARMY OF MEN AND GO STRAIGHTWAY TO SEEK ROBIN HOOD LIKEWISE THE KING GAVE SIR WILLIAM HIS SIGNET RING TOSHOW TO THE SHERIFF THAT HE MIGHT RAISE ALL HIS ARMED MEN TO AID THE OTHERS IN THEIR CHASE OF ROBIN SO SIR WILLIAM AND THE SHERIFF SET FORTH TO DO THE KINGS BIDDING AND TO SEARCH FOR ROBIN HOOD AND FOR SEVEN DAYS THEY HUNTED UP AND DOWN YET FOUND HIM NOT NOW HAD ROBIN HOOD BEEN AS PEACEFUL AS OF OLD EVERYTHING MIGHT HAVE ENDED IN SMOKE AS OTHER SUCH VENTURES HAD ALWAYS DONE BEFORE BUT HE HAD FOUGHT FOR YEARS UNDER KING RICHARD AND WAS CHANGED FROM WHAT HE USED TO BE IT GALLED HIS PRIDE TO THUS FLEE AWAY BEFORE THOSE SENT AGAINST HIM AS A CHASED FOX FLEES FROM THE HOUNDS SO THUS IT CAME ABOUT AT LAST THAT ROBIN HOOD AND HIS YEOMEN MET SIR WILLIAM AND THE SHERIFF AND THEIR MEN IN THE FOREST AND A BLOODY FIGHT FOLLOWED THE FIRST MAN SLAIN IN THAT FIGHT WAS THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM FOR HE FELL FROM HIS HORSE WITH AN ARROW IN HIS BRAIN ERE HALF A SCORE OF SHAFTS HAD BEEN SPED MANY A BETTER MAN THAN THE SHERIFF KISSED THE SOD THAT DAY BUT AT LAST SIR WILLIAM DALE BEING WOUNDED AND MOST OF HIS MEN SLAIN HE WITHDREW BEATEN AND LEFT THE FOREST BUT SCORES OF GOOD FELLOWS WERE LEFT BEHIND HIM STRETCHED OUT ALL STIFF BENEATH THE SWEET GREEN BOUGHS BUT THOUGH ROBIN HOOD HAD BEATEN OFF HIS ENEMIES IN FAIR FIGHT ALL THIS LAY HEAVILY UPON HIS MIND SO THAT HE BROODED OVER IT UNTIL A FEVER SEIZED UPON HIM FOR THREE DAYS IT HELD HIM AND THOUGH HE STROVE TO FIGHT IT OFF HE WAS FORCED TO YIELD AT LAST THUS IT CAME THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH DAY HE CALLED LITTLE JOHN TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT SHAKE THE FEVER FROM HIM AND THAT HE WOULD GO TO HIS COUSIN THE PRIORESS OF THE NUNNERY NEAR KIRKLEES IN YORKSHIRE WHO WAS A SKILLFUL LEECH AND HE WOULD HAVE HER OPEN A VEIN IN HIS ARM AND TAKE A LITTLE BLOOD FROM HIM FOR THE BETTERING OF HIS HEALTH THEN HE BADE LITTLE JOHN MAKE READY TO GO ALSO FOR HE MIGHT PERCHANCE NEED AID IN HIS JOURNEYING SO LITTLE JOHN AND HE TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF THE OTHERS AND ROBIN HOOD BADE WILL STUTELY BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND UNTIL THEY SHOULD COME BACK THUS THEY CAME BY EASY STAGES AND SLOW JOURNEYING UNTIL THEY REACHED THE NUNNERY OF KIRKLEES NOW ROBIN HAD DONE MUCH TO AID THIS COUSIN OF HIS FOR IT WAS THROUGH KING RICHARDS LOVE OF HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE PRIORESS OF THE PLACE BUT THERE IS NOUGHT IN THE WORLD SO EASILY FORGOT AS GRATITUDE SO WHEN THE PRIORESS OF KIRKLEES HAD HEARD HOW HER COUSIN THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON HAD THROWN AWAY HIS EARLDOM AND GONE BACK AGAIN TO SHERWOOD SHE WAS VEXED TO THE SOUL AND FEARED LEST HER COUSINSHIP WITH HIM SHOULD BRING THE KINGS WRATH UPON HER ALSO THUS IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN ROBIN CAME TO HER AND TOLD HER HOW HE WISHED HER SERVICES AS LEECH SHE BEGAN PLOTTING ILL AGAINST HIM IN HER MIND THINKING THAT BY DOING EVIL TO HIM SHE MIGHT FIND FAVOR WITH HIS ENEMIES NEVERTHELESS SHE KEPT THIS WELL TO HERSELF AND RECEIVED ROBIN WITH SEEMING KINDNESS SHE LED HIM UP THE WINDING STONE STAIR TO A ROOM WHICH WAS JUST BENEATH THE EAVES OF A HIGH ROUND TOWER BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET LITTLE JOHN COME WITH HIM SO THE POOR YEOMAN TURNED HIS FEET AWAY FROM THE DOOR OF THE NUNNERY AND LEFT HIS MASTER IN THE HANDS OF THE WOMEN BUT THOUGH HE DID NOT COME IN NEITHER DID HE GO FAR AWAY FOR HE LAID HIM DOWN IN A LITTLE GLADE NEAR BY WHEREHE COULD WATCH THE PLACE THAT ROBIN ABIDED LIKE SOME GREAT FAITHFUL DOG TURNED AWAY FROM THE DOOR WHERE HIS MASTER HAS ENTERED AFTER THE WOMEN HAD GOTTEN ROBIN HOOD TO THE ROOM BENEATH THE EAVES THE PRIORESS SENT ALL OF THE OTHERS AWAY THEN TAKING A LITTLE CORD SHE TIED IT TIGHTLY ABOUT ROBINS ARM AS THOUGH SHE WERE ABOUT TO BLEED HIM AND SO SHE DID BLEED HIM BUT THE VEIN SHE OPENED WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE THAT LIE CLOSE AND BLUE BENEATH THE SKIN DEEPER SHE CUT THAN THAT FOR SHE OPENED ONE OF THOSE VEINS THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT RED BLOOD RUNS LEAPING FROM THE HEART OF THIS ROBIN KNEW NOT FOR THOUGH HE SAW THE BLOOD FLOW IT DID NOT COME FAST ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM THINK THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING ILL IN IT HAVING DONE THIS VILE DEED THE PRIORESS TURNED AND LEFT HER COUSIN LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HER ALL THAT LIVELONG DAY THE BLOOD RAN FROM ROBIN HOODS ARM NOR COULD HE CHECK IT THOUGH HE STROVE IN EVERY WAY TO DO SO AGAIN AND AGAIN HE CALLED FOR HELP BUT NO HELP CAME FOR HIS COUSIN HAD BETRAYED HIM AND LITTLE JOHN WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO HEAR HIS VOICE SO HE BLED AND BLED UNTIL HE FELT HIS STRENGTH SLIPPING AWAY FROM HIM THEN HE AROSE TOTTERING AND BEARING HIMSELF UP BY THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS AGAINST THE WALL HE REACHED HIS BUGLE HORN AT LAST THRICE HE SOUNDED IT BUT WEAKLY AND FAINTLY FOR HIS BREATH WAS FLUTTERING THROUGH SICKNESS AND LOSS OF STRENGTH NEVERTHELESS LITTLE JOHN HEARD IT WHERE HE LAY IN THE GLADE AND WITH A HEART ALL SICK WITH DREAD HE CAME RUNNING AND LEAPING TOWARD THE NUNNERY LOUDLY HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND IN A LOUD VOICE SHOUTED FOR THEM TO LET HIM IN BUT THE DOOR WAS OF MASSIVE OAK STRONGLY BARREDAND STUDDED WITH SPIKES SO THEY FELT SAFE AND BADE LITTLE JOHN BEGONE THEN LITTLE JOHNS HEART WAS MAD WITH GRIEF AND FEAR FOR HIS MASTERS LIFE WILDLY HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SIGHT FELL UPON A HEAVY STONE MORTAR SUCH AS THREE MEN COULD NOT LIFT NOWADAYS LITTLE JOHN TOOK THREE STEPS FORWARD AND BENDING HIS BACK HEAVED THE STONE MORTAR UP FROM WHERE IT STOOD DEEPLY ROOTED STAGGERING UNDER ITS WEIGHT HE CAME FORWARD AND HURLED IT CRASHING AGAINST THE DOOR IN BURST THE DOOR AND AWAY FLED THE FRIGHTENED NUNS SHRIEKING AT HIS COMING THEN LITTLE JOHN STRODE IN AND NEVER A WORD SAID HE BUT UP THE WINDING STONE STEPS HE RAN TILL HE REACHED THE ROOM WHEREIN HIS MASTER WAS HERE HE FOUND THE DOOR LOCKED ALSO BUT PUTTING HIS SHOULDER AGAINST IT HE BURST THE LOCKS AS THOUGH THEY WERE MADE OF BRITTLE ICE THERE HE SAW HIS OWN DEAR MASTER LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY STONE WALL HIS FACE ALL WHITE AND DRAWN AND HIS HEAD SWAYING TO AND FRO WITH WEAKNESS THEN WITH A GREAT WILD CRY OF LOVE AND GRIEF AND PITY LITTLE JOHN LEAPED FORWARD AND CAUGHT ROBIN HOOD IN HIS ARMS UP HE LIFTED HIM AS A MOTHER LIFTS HER CHILD AND CARRYING HIM TO THE BED LAID HIM TENDERLY THEREON AND NOW THE PRIORESS CAME IN HASTILY FOR SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT SHE HAD DONE AND DREADED THE VENGEANCE OF LITTLE JOHN AND THE OTHERS OF THE BAND THEN SHE STANCHED THE BLOOD BY CUNNING BANDAGES SO THAT IT FLOWED NO MORE ALL THE WHILE LITTLE JOHN STOOD GRIMLY BY AND AFTER SHE HAD DONE HE STERNLY BADE HER TO BEGONE AND SHE OBEYED PALE AND TREMBLING THEN AFTER SHE HAD DEPARTED LITTLE JOHNSPAKE CHEERING WORDS LAUGHING LOUDLY AND SAYING THAT ALL THIS WAS A CHILDS FRIGHT AND THAT NO STOUT YEOMAN WOULD DIE AT THE LOSS OF A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD WHY QUOTH HE GIVE THEE A SEENNIGHT AND THOU WILT BE ROAMING THE WOODLANDS AS BOLDLY AS EVER BUT ROBIN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SMILED FAINTLY WHERE HE LAY MINE OWN DEAR LITTLE JOHN WHISPERED HE HEAVEN BLESS THY KIND ROUGH HEART BUT DEAR FRIEND WE WILL NEVER ROAM THE WOODLANDS TOGETHER AGAIN AY BUT WE WILL QUOTH LITTLE JOHN LOUDLY I SAY AGAIN AY OUT UPON IT WHO DARES SAY THAT ANY MORE HARM SHALL COME UPON THEE AM I NOT BY LET ME SEE WHO DARES TOUCH HERE HE STOPPED OF A SUDDEN FOR HIS WORDS CHOKED HIM AT LAST HE SAID IN A DEEP HUSKY VOICE NOW IF AUGHT OF HARM BEFALLS THEE BECAUSE OF THIS DAYS DOINGS I SWEAR BY SAINT GEORGE THAT THE RED COCK SHALL CROW OVER THE ROOFTREE OF THIS HOUSE FOR THE HOT FLAMES SHALL LICK EVERY CRACK AND CRANNY THEREOF AS FOR THESE WOMEN HERE HE GROUND HIS TEETH IT WILL BE AN ILL DAY FOR THEM BUT ROBIN HOOD TOOK LITTLE JOHNS ROUGH BROWN FIST IN HIS WHITE HANDS AND CHID HIM SOFTLY IN HIS LOW WEAK VOICE ASKING HIM SINCE WHAT TIME LITTLE JOHN HAD THOUGHT OF DOING HARM TO WOMEN EVEN IN VENGEANCE THUS HE TALKED TILL AT LAST THE OTHER PROMISED IN A CHOKING VOICE THAT NO ILL SHOULD FALL UPON THE PLACE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED THEN A SILENCE FELL AND LITTLE JOHN SAT WITH ROBIN HOODS HAND IN HIS GAZING OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW EVER AND ANON SWALLOWING A GREAT LUMP THAT CAME IN HIS THROAT MEANTIME THE SUN DROPPED SLOWLY TO THE WEST TILL ALL THE SKY WAS ABLAZE WITH ARED GLORY THEN ROBIN HOOD IN A WEAK FALTERING VOICE BADE LITTLE JOHN RAISE HIM THAT HE MIGHT LOOK OUT ONCE MORE UPON THE WOODLANDS SO THE YEOMAN LIFTED HIM IN HIS ARMS AS HE BADE AND ROBIN HOODS HEAD LAY ON HIS FRIENDS SHOULDER LONG HE GAZED WITH A WIDE LINGERING LOOK WHILE THE OTHER SAT WITH BOWED HEAD THE HOT TEARS ROLLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER FROM HIS EYES AND DRIPPING UPON HIS BOSOM FOR HE FELT THAT THE TIME OF PARTING WAS NEAR AT HAND THEN PRESENTLY ROBIN HOOD BADE HIM STRING HIS STOUT BOW FOR HIM AND CHOOSE A SMOOTH FAIR ARROW FROM HIS QUIVER THIS LITTLE JOHN DID THOUGH WITHOUT DISTURBING HIS MASTER OR RISING FROM WHERE HE SAT ROBIN HOODS FINGERS WRAPPED LOVINGLY AROUND HIS GOOD BOW AND HE SMILED FAINTLY WHEN HE FELT IT IN HIS GRASP THEN HE NOCKED THE ARROW ON THAT PART OF THE STRING THAT THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS KNEW SO WELL LITTLE JOHN SAID HE LITTLE JOHN MINE OWN DEAR FRIEND AND HIM I LOVE BETTER THAN ALL OTHERS IN THE WORLD MARK I PRYTHEE WHERE THIS ARROW LODGES AND THERE LET MY GRAVE BE DIGGED LAY ME WITH MY FACE TOWARD THE EAST LITTLE JOHN AND SEE THAT MY RESTING PLACE BE KEPT GREEN AND THAT MY WEARY BONES BE NOT DISTURBED AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING HE RAISED HIMSELF OF A SUDDEN AND SAT UPRIGHT HIS OLD STRENGTH SEEMED TO COME BACK TO HIM AND DRAWING THE BOWSTRING TO HIS EAR HE SPED THE ARROW OUT OF THE OPEN CASEMENT AS THE SHAFT FLEW HIS HAND SANK SLOWLY WITH THE BOW TILL IT LAY ACROSS HIS KNEES AND HIS BODY LIKEWISE SANK BACK AGAIN INTO LITTLE JOHNS LOVING ARMS BUT SOMETHING HAD SPED FROM THAT BODY EVEN AS THE WINGED ARROW SPED FROM THE BOW FOR SOME MINUTES LITTLE JOHN SAT MOTIONLESS BUT PRESENTLY HE LAID THAT WHICH HE HELD GENTLY DOWN THEN FOLDING THE HANDS UPON THE BREAST AND COVERING UP THE FACE HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT A WORD OR A SOUND UPON THE STEEP STAIRWAY HE MET THE PRIORESS AND SOME OF THE CHIEF AMONG THE SISTERS TO THEM HE SPOKE IN A DEEP QUIVERING VOICE AND SAID HE AN YE GO WITHIN A SCORE OF FEET OF YONDER ROOM I WILL TEAR DOWN YOUR ROOKERY OVER YOUR HEADS SO THAT NOT ONE STONE SHALL BE LEFT UPON ANOTHER BEAR MY WORDS WELL IN MIND FOR I MEAN THEM SO SAYING HE TURNED AND LEFT THEM AND THEY PRESENTLY SAW HIM RUNNING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE OPEN THROUGH THE FALLING OF THE DUSK UNTIL HE WAS SWALLOWED UP BY THE FOREST THE EARLY GRAY OF THE COMING MORN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO LIGHTEN THE BLACK SKY TOWARD THE EASTWARD WHEN LITTLE JOHN AND SIX MORE OF THE BAND CAME RAPIDLY ACROSS THE OPEN TOWARD THE NUNNERY THEY SAW NO ONE FOR THE SISTERS WERE ALL HIDDEN AWAY FROM SIGHT HAVING BEEN FRIGHTENED BY LITTLE JOHNS WORDS UP THE STONE STAIR THEY RAN AND A GREAT SOUND OF WEEPING WAS PRESENTLY HEARD AFTER A WHILE THIS CEASED AND THEN CAME THE SCUFFLING AND SHUFFLING OF MENS FEET AS THEY CARRIED A HEAVY WEIGHT DOWN THE STEEP AND WINDING STAIRS SO THEY WENT FORTH FROM THE NUNNERY AND AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE DOORS THEREOF A GREAT LOUD SOUND OF WAILING AROSE FROM THE GLADE THAT LAY ALL DARK IN THE DAWNING AS THOUGH MANY MEN HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS HAD LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES IN SORROW THUS DIED ROBIN HOOD AT KIRKLEES NUNNERY IN FAIR YORKSHIRE WITH MERCY IN HIS HEART TOWARD THOSE THAT HAD BEEN HIS UNDOING FOR THUS HE SHOWED MERCY FOR THE ERRINGAND PITY FOR THE WEAK THROUGH ALL THE TIME OF HIS LIVING HIS YEOMEN WERE SCATTERED HENCEFORTH BUT NO GREAT ILL BEFELL THEM THEREAFTER FOR A MORE MERCIFUL SHERIFF AND ONE WHO KNEW THEM NOT SO WELL SUCCEEDING THE ONE THAT HAD GONE AND THEY BEING SEPARATED HERE AND THERE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE THEY ABIDED IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS SO THAT MANY LIVED TO HAND DOWN THESE TALES TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDRENS CHILDREN A
